    <div slot="message">With this solution, you won't get automatic updates. You will need to check the <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> for potential breaking changes and update your local copy every time.</div>

If your project toolchain is not based on Node.js and npm, you can copy-paste the CSS file in your own source code.

The CSS file to copy is available at (replace `<VERSION>` with the one you're using):

```

```
