# Web Components guidelines

Here are different rules we want any contributor to follow regarding how we write Web Components with LitElement.

## General rules and reminders

* Don't forget to document your component's public API (properties, attributes, methods, events, slots, CSS custom props...)
* Your component should be UI only and NOT COUPLED with where the data comes from
* Don't forget to init your property default values in the constructor (see ['cc-example-component' constructor](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/docs/cc-example-component.js#L76))
* Use the [`dispatchCustomEvent` helper](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/9c8b046d21a734159b007646f042eb8053297168/src/lib/events.js) and try to emit your value directly on `detail` ([see 'cc-pricing-estimation' _onChangeQuantity method](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/src/pricing/cc-pricing-estimation.js#L83))
* In the data I/O, prefer array of objects (instead of object literals) for collections
* Always name your event handlers "_onSomething"
* Try to sort your CSS sources in each selector (alphabetically) (enforced by the linter)
* Declare all public properties in the static get properties (['cc-example-component' property getter](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/docs/cc-example-component.js))
* Think about what will happen when there's an error
* Think about what will happen when the data is not there yet, <br/> for this, we use the "skeleton screen" pattern
* Think about what will happen when the data is empty, <br/> don't forget to add a message
* Think about the focus, where does it go when something is validated or when an element disappears
* Use `// language=CSS` over your `css` declaration so WebStorm can apply syntaxic coloration and more (see ['cc-example-component-stories'](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/docs/cc-example-component.stories.js#L18))
* Use `// language=HTML` in your stories so WebStorm can apply syntaxic coloration and more
* Try to avoid the quotes for this `prop="${this.prop}"` and do this instead: `prop=${this.prop}`
* Make sure all texts are translated
* Prefix all translation keys with the component name and split parts with dots (see ['translation-example'](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/docs/translations.example.js#L37))

## How to order stuff in a custom element using LitElement?

In order to help anyone reading this code base to find what s.he's looking for,
we're proposing this order for the different pars of a custom element built with LitElement:

1. LitElement's properties descriptor <br/> `static get properties () {}`
1. Constructor <br/> `constructor () {}`
1. property getters <br/> `get myProp () {}`
1. property setters <br/> `set myProp (value) {}`
1. public methods <br/> `myMethodName (arg0, arg1) {}`
1. private methods (prefixed with an underscore) <br/> `_myMethodName (arg0, arg1) {}`
1. event handlers (almost always private, prefixed with `_on`) <br/> `_onClickToggle (e) {}`
1. custom element lifecycle callbacks <br/> `connectedCallback () {}`
1. LitElement lifecycle callbacks <br/> `firstUpdated () {}`
1. LitElement's render method <br/> `render () {}`
1. sub render private methods <br/> `_renderFoobar () {}`
1. LitElement's styles descriptor <br/> `static get styles () {}`

## How to order attributes when you use a component?

1. `class` attribute
1. other attributes
1. event listeners

## How to document a component?

* Always start a description with an upper case letter and end it with a dot.
* Global component description starts with "A component", "A wrapper", "A helper", "An input", "A form", ...
* Global component description is a simple one-liner.
* Global component description can have a `## Details` section with a bullet list of informations.
* Global component description can have a `## Type definitions` section to document the `type` and `interface` of the properties and events (see ['cc-example-component' typedef section](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/blob/master/docs/cc-example-component.js#L80)).
* This `## Type definitions` section consists of a group of code samples using the TypeScript definition format.
* Global component description can have a `## Technical details` section for stuffs that don't concern users.
* Global component description can have other sections specific to custom behaviours.
* Properties' descriptions start with a verb at the 3rd person "Sets", "Enables", "Displays", ...
* Events' descriptions start with "Fires whenever..." or "Fires XXX whenever..." when the event passes data.
* Events' type should be `CustomEvent` or `CustomEvent<MyType>` to describe the type of the `detail` property of a custom event.
* Don't forget to set default values for booleans in the constructor.
* Use `@prop` instead of `@attr`.
* Please sort your props and events alphabetically.
* Respect the following order: `@prop`, `@fires`, `@slot`, `@cssprop`
* Document methods in place, just above the given method.
* Use a `/** @required */` if component breaks without a given property. Must be in the `static get properties` section.

## How to choose icons?

By default, try to use icons that are parts of the Remix Icon library which is embedded in the main package.

If there is no suiting icon, you can add a custom icon to the Clever Cloud corporate icons (in the `src/assets/` folder).

<cc-notice intent="info" message="The custom icon must be in SVG format, with no hard-coded color and not relying on `stroke`. Its design should match the other icons as well."></cc-notice>
