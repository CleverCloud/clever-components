# ðŸ“– Guidelines

<cc-notice intent="warning" message="This doc is a work in progress..."></cc-notice>

This section will cover how we design our components, from a global perspective but also from a component level.
The guides will mostly be recommendations and best practices and not intangible rules.

Expected soon:

- our design principles,
- guidelines about layout, list, form, button, interaction and more!
