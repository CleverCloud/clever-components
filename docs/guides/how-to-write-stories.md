# How to write stories

We're trying to enforce a few names/titles for our stories.
This is a great way for developers not to forget cases like error, empty, skeleton/loading...
This is also a great way for users to recognize patterns in our components.

## General rules and reminders

* Try to show off your components in all the different possible situations (data-wise) with a set of fake data that resemble what could happen in production.
* If you handle user inputs, think about cases where the text is very long.
* Think about what happens if it fails (error in general).
* Think about what happens while we're waiting for the data (loading, updating...).
* Think about what happens if there are no data.
* Try to show off a time-simulation like "loading" then "data is loaded". 

## Generic names

We want to keep consistency between our stories so we're proposing special names and prefixes:

* If you only have one story, name it `defaultStory`.
* If you have one main story, and a few other cases, name it `defaultStory`.
* ‚åõ If you're showing off a component in it's "no data yet" state with a skeleton screen UI pattern, name it `skeleton`.
* ‚åõ If you're showing off a component in it's "no data yet" state with a loading indicator, name it `loading`.
* üï≥ If you're showing off a component in it's "data loaded but empty data", start your story name with `empty`.
* üëç If you're showing off a component with data loaded in different contexts, start your story name with `dataLoaded`.
* üìà If you're showing off a component with data in a time-simulation like "loading" then "data is loaded", start your story name with `simulation`.
* üî• If you're showing off a component with an error, start your story name with `error`.

NOTE: If you need to specify some details about your story, use `with` and it will trigger parens in the displayed title.

Examples:

* `errorWithLoadingIndicator` => üî• Error (loading indicator)
* `dataLoadedWithDisabled` => üëç Data loaded (disabled)
* `simulationWithFoobarAttribute` => üìà Simulation (foobar attribute)

To enable this behaviour, you need to call `enhanceStoriesNames({ /* stories */ });` from `stories/lib/story-names.js` at the end of your story file.

Example:

```js
import { enhanceStoriesNames } from '../lib/story-names.js';

export const skeleton = () => { /* story code */ };
export const error = () => { /* story code */ };
export const empty = () => { /* story code */ };
export const dataLoaded = () => { /* story code */ };
export const simulations = () => { /* story code */ };

enhanceStoriesNames({ skeleton, error, empty, dataLoaded, simulations });
```

You'll end up with those stories (sorted in alpha order):

* üëç Data loaded
* üï≥ Empty (no data)
* üî• Error
* üìà Simulations
* ‚åõ Skeleton (no data yet)

## Using `makeStory`

Writing stories with plain HTML (with or without Lit) can become very verbose.
That's why we created a helper function called `makeStory`.
It provides several features to improve the whole writing/maintaining stories experience:

* Define multiple instances of the same component for one story
* Override the story name
* Specify a description for the story
* Specify some custom CSS for the story
* Provide raw DOM instead of component name and props if necessary
* Generate a simulation to show how a component behaves when going from one state to another
* Override the argument types

### Basic usage

The `makeStory()` function will help you to present one or many instances of a given component.
It takes an object with at least the `component` and `items` properties:

* Use the `component` property to define the name of the component to present (ex: `cc-example-component`).
* Use the `items` property to define the number of instances of the component you want to present and which properties to assign to them.

Here's an example where we want to present one instance of the `<cc-example-component>` component with `one` set to `ONE` and `two` set to `false`.

```js
export const firstStory = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component',
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});
```

Here's an example where we want to present 2 instances of the `<cc-example-component>` with different values for the `two` property.

```js
export const secondStory = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component',
  items: [
    { one: 'ONE', two: false },
    { one: 'ONE', two: true },
  ],
});
```

If you need those two stories in the same file, you can move common properties to an object and call `makeStory` with multiple arguments:

```js
// Common config
const conf = {
  component: 'cc-example-component',
}

export const firstStory = makeStory(conf, {
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});

export const secondStory = makeStory(conf, {
  items: [
    { one: 'ONE', two: false },
    { one: 'ONE', two: true },
  ],
});
```

The `makeStory` function takes as many arguments as you need, they're merged with the last one winning.
This means this example:

```js
const confOne = { component: 'cc-example-component' };
const confTwo = { css: `cc-example-component { margin-botton }`, docs: 'the docs' };
const confThree = { docs: 'the real docs' };

export const storyWithManyArgs = makeStory(confOne, confTwo, confThree, {
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});
```

is equivalent to this example:

```js
export const storyWithOneArg = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component'
  css: `cc-example-component { margin-botton }`,
  docs: 'the real docs',
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});
```

**NOTE:** You can also provide a function to `items` as long as it returns the same kind of array of objects.

This is very handy when you deal with dates and want to make sure the properties are generated when the story is rendered.

```js
export const storyWithItemsAsFunction = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component',
  items: () => [{ isoDate: new Date().toISOString() }],
});
```

### Override story name

Most of the time, you won't need to specify a custom story name because you will use the `enhanceStoriesNames()` helper function.
If you really need to override the story's name, you can do it with the `name` property.

```js
export const storyWithName = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component',
  name: 'Custom story name',
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});
```

### Set a description

We should use this more often in this project, but you can specify a documentation/description for each story with the `docs` property.
It accepts markdown, and it will be displayed in the docs page above the story.

```js
export const storyWithDocs = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component',
  docs: `This is an **awesome** description with:

* some markdown
* list items
  `,
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});
```

### Set some custom CSS styles

Sometimes you will need to use custom CSS styles for your stories.
Here's an example where we want to present 2 instances of our component, separated by a `1em` margin.

```js
export const storyWithCss = makeStory({
  component: 'cc-example-component',
  css: `
    cc-example-component {
      margin-botton: 1em;
    }
  `,
  items: [
    { one: 'ONE', two: false },
    { one: 'ONE', two: true },
  ],
});
```

### Use raw DOM

In some situations, you will prefer raw DOM over the component instantiation.
You can do this with the `dom` function.
Here's an example where we define some raw HTML inside the container of the story.

```js
export const storyWithCss = makeStory({
  dom: (container) => {
    // Add anything you need in the container element
    container.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello</h1>`;
  },
});
```

### Present state changes with simulations

With stories, you can present a component in any given state.
Sometimes, it's useful to present how a component behaves when it changes from one state to another.
You can do this with the `simulations` property.
Here's an example where we start with 2 instances of our component.
After 2 seconds, the first one sees its `two` property evolve to true and the second one gets an error.

```js
export const storyWithSimulations = makeStory(conf, {
  items: [
    { one: 'ONE', two: false },
    { one: 'ONE', two: false },
  ],
  simulations: [
    storyWait(2000, ([component, componentError]) => {
      component.one = 'ONE OK';
      component.two = true;
      componentError.one = 'ONE ERROR';
      componentError.error = true;
    }),
  ],
});
```

* The `simulations` array can take as many async functions as you need, they will all be executed.
* The `storyWait()` function can help you to wait before applying a state change to your components.
  * The first argument is the delay in milliseconds.
  * The second argument is the callback, it will be called with the instances of the component.

### Override argument types

If you want, you can override the argument types of the story to improve the controls with the `argTypes` property.
See https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/api/argtypes for more details.

Here's an example where we provide a 2-choice radio input for the `one` property: 

```js
export const storyWithSimulations = makeStory(conf, {
  argTypes: {
    variant: {
      options: ['aaaaaa', 'bbbbbb'],
      control: { type: 'radio' },
    },
  },
  items: [{ one: 'ONE', two: false }],
});
```
