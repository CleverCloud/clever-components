<p><strong>Since last year, OpenAI has been in the news with its large language models (LLM), notably GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, available through ChatGPT. But you can also include them within your own applications thanks to an API. Here's an example of how you can take advantage of it on Clever Cloud.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We'll use the open source <a href="https://github.com/unconv/chat-wtf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chat-wtf</a> project, created by Unconventional Coding, who detailed the conception stages in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUz4CtalhY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of videos</a>. It is primarily based on <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/product/mysql/">the PHP language</a>  and data storage via sessions, SQLite or <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/fr/product/mysql-a-traduire-en-fr/">MySQL</a>, according to user choice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An open-source ChatGPT, you can use on demand</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It requires you to use <a href="https://platform.openai.com/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the OpenAI API</a>, but you may look at compatible models if you're more daring. The settings file also allows you to specify a "system message". So, you can provide the AI with informations about you or your expectations, which it should take into consideration when answering your questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This PHP application has not been developed in any particular way for Clever Cloud, but you can host it on our infrastructure in just a few minutes, configure it according to your needs, stop and start it on demand. Here's how.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href="https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/session/signup">Create a Clever Cloud account</a>&nbsp;(and get 20 euros in credits)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To get started, you'll need a Clever Cloud account and an OpenAI API key. You can create the application and follow this tutorial using our web interface, <a href="https://console.clever-cloud.com/">the Console</a>, but also through our open source CLI: <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clever Tools</a>. That's what we'll describe below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting the code and configuration</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We'll assume that your machine is running <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">git</a> and a recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Node.js</a>. If you haven't yet installed Clever Tools on your system, type (with system administrator rights, or <code>sudo</code> if necessary):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">npm i -g clever-tools
clever login</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once logged in, you can check that everything has gone smoothly with the following command:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever profile</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then you can create a fork of chat-wtf that can be deployed on Clever Cloud from your GitHub account. In this guide, we'll clone the repository locally and create a Clever Cloud application in it. A remote required for its deployment will be automatically added:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/unconv/chat-wtf.git && cd chat-wtf
clever create -t php chat-wtf</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, you have a local copy of the latest version of the chat-wtf application, which you can configure to match your needs. Rename <code>settings.sample.php</code> to <code>settings.php</code>. We'll start with some minor modifications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Put in the following content to use environment variables:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-php">&#x3C;?php
return [
    &#x22;api_key&#x22; =&#x3E; getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    &#x22;system_message&#x22; =&#x3E; getenv("SYSTEM_MESSAGE"),
    &#x22;model&#x22; =&#x3E; &#x22;gpt-3.5-turbo&#x22;,
    &#x22;base_uri&#x22; =&#x3E; &#x22;&#x22;,
    &#x22;storage_type&#x22; =&#x3E; &#x22;session&#x22;,
];</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edit the <code>.gitignore</code> file and remove <code>settings.php</code> so that it can be deployed with your application. Now that it's configured, you only need to set the environment variables required to ensure it works properly, and then deploy. Note that it runs on PHP 8.x. We'll be using the 8.2 branch:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever env set CC_PHP_VERSION "8.2"
clever env set OPENAI_API_KEY "Your OpenAI API key"
clever env set SYSTEM_MESSAGE "Your system message"
git add . && git commit -m "First deploy"
clever deploy && clever open</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the environment variables have been set, we perform a simple Git Push. The application is then deployed on Clever Cloud, an archive is created to ease its redeployment, and if all has gone well, it's opened in your browser:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":10576,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/10/image-2.png" alt="Chat WTF on Clever Cloud" class="wp-image-10576"/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with any application hosted within our service, you can simply assign it a domain that will benefit from our <a href="https://www.sozu.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S≈çzu</a> load balancer and a Let's Encrypt certificate, get its status and activity, stop or restart it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://console.clever-cloud.com">The Console</a> provides metrics and links to a Grafana dashboard to monitor its status. You can also adjust the size of the instance or activate auto-scalability to handle different load levels:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever console

clever domain
clever domain add domain.tld

clever status
clever activity

clever scale --min-instances 1 --max-instances 4 --min-flavor pico --max-flavor M
clever scale --instances 1 --flavor pico

clever restart
clever stop</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Let's add a database to our chat-wtf instance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned previously, this project can store its data within PHP sessions, but also via SQLite or MySQL. In this example, we'll opt for the latter to show you how it can be done, in a very simple way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, let's create a MySQL database within your Clever Cloud account, linking it directly to your application. By default it's a DEV instance, shared and free, but you can request <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/pricing/">a larger plan</a> if needed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever addon create mysql-addon chat-wtf-mysql --link chat-wtf</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This "link" allows connection parameters to be injected directly into the application using environment variables. These are visible in the Console or via Clever Tools :</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever env</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, all you need is to modify the <code>settings.php</code> file as follows to use it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-php">    &#x22;storage_type&#x22; =&#x3E; &#x22;sql&#x22;,
    &#x22;db&#x22; =&#x3E; [
        &#x22;dsn&#x22; =&#x3E; &#x22;mysql:host=&#x22; . getenv(&#x27;MYSQL_ADDON_HOST&#x27;) . &#x22;;
                    port=&#x22; . getenv(&#x27;MYSQL_ADDON_PORT&#x27;) . &#x22;;
                    dbname=&#x22; . getenv(&#x27;MYSQL_ADDON_DB&#x27;),
        &#x22;username&#x22; =&#x3E; getenv(&#x27;MYSQL_ADDON_USER&#x27;),
        &#x22;password&#x22; =&#x3E; getenv(&#x27;MYSQL_ADDON_PASSWORD&#x27;),
    ],</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then go to the MySQL database dashboard, accessible in the Console. You'll find a link to its PHPMyAdmin interface. Click on the database name in the left-hand menu, then you'll get to the import function. This will enable you to initiate the DB structure by importing the <code>mysql.sql</code> file located in the repository's db folder. Set its location and click on "Import". You're done:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":10570,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/10/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/10/image.png" alt="MySQL Import" class="wp-image-10570"/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All that you remains to do is redeploy your application, which will now use the MySQL database to store its data rather than PHP sessions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">git add settings.php && git commit -m "Add MySQL support"
clever deploy && clever open</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If this doesn't work, check errors in your instance logs on the Console or via :</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever logs</code></pre>

<p>Clever Cloud is today the main developer of <a href="https://www.sozu.io/">S≈çzu</a>, a Reverse Proxy that was developped at Clever Cloud, in <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2016/11/02/falling-for-rust/">Rust</a>, to meet the needs of our infrastructure for performance and hot reloading. S≈çzu is used throughout Clever Cloud, paired with HAProxy, to route traffic to our customer's applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/07/canvas-1-358x447.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8027 size-full"/></figure></div>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What we used to do: </strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until now, our Reverse Proxy S≈çzu used to be managed by Clever Cloud by a closed source program that ran on the same machine and assumed two big responsibilities:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Firstly, listen to a RabbitMQ topic and redirect requests to S≈çzu (via its UNIX socket)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Secondly, watch over a PKI directory (Public Key Infrastructure) to redirect TLS certificates to S≈çzu (via its UNIX socket)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning open source</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While working on a new Prometheus connector for S≈çzu, we realized we could open source it. With this realization came the idea of porting the logic of the former S≈çzu manager (described above) from its closed source state into new open source repositories.<br>What we ultimately aim to develop is an entirely <strong>open-source</strong> <strong>ecosystem around our Reverse Proxy S≈çzu</strong>.<br>This blog post details what these new open source components are, and summarizes what they do.</p>

<p>PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure, an omnipresent security framework on the Internet, typically used for securing connections with HTTPS (among other things). In the PKI framework, S≈çzu functions as a <strong>TLS endpoint</strong>: it decrypts HTTPS traffic into HTTP traffic.<br>The S≈çzu PKI connector runs alongside S≈çzu, watches over a given directory in the file system, reads TLS certificates that were put there by either human or machine, and transmits them to S≈çzu.<br>Then , what this ultimately means is: <strong>write a TLS certificate on the machine, S≈çzu will have it.</strong> </p>

<p>This is a code library used by all above connectors. It pools connections to S≈çzu's UNIX socket and functions entirely asynchronously. All in all, it makes <strong>writing new connectors easier</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>What's next</strong><br>The best thing we wish is for the open-source community to join us in using and improving S≈çzu as it goes. Our end-game is to build a web UI to manage a S≈çzu instance in the navigator.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a code library used by all above connectors. It pools connections to S≈çzu's UNIX socket and functions entirely asynchronously. All in all, it makes <strong>writing new connectors easier</strong>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What's next</strong><br>The best thing we wish is for the open-source community to join us in using and improving S≈çzu as it goes. Our end-game is to build a web UI to manage a S≈çzu instance in the navigator.</p>

<p><strong>For more than a year now, Jarred Sumner and his team have been working on a new open source JavaScript runtime: <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bun</a>. <strong> It's touted as more efficient and feature-rich than current solutions such as Node.js or Deno</strong>. Version 1.0.3 <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just been released</a>, and you can already use it for your projects hosted by Clever Cloud.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While we like to automate and simplify everything for our customers, we do so while leaving as much freedom as possible. Thus, hosting <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/product/node-js-applications/">a Node.js application</a> with the framework or package manager of your choice can be done without any particular constraints, and deploying a website takes only a few minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We already support <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2020/05/19/deploy-deno/">Deno</a>, <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/deploy/application/javascript/by-framework/meteor/">Meteor.js</a>, <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/deploy/application/javascript/by-framework/nodejs/#supported-package-managers">yarn</a>. While we haven't yet taken the decision to integrate Bun natively into our images, as we await initial feedback from our customers, it's all very straightforward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hello, Bun on Clever Cloud!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Want to give it a try? All you need is a Clever Cloud account, or create one from an e-mail address or GitHub account. We'll give you 20 euros worth of credits when you sign up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><a href="https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/session/signup">Create a Clever Cloud account</a> (and get 20 euros in credits)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For this first example, we'll assume that you have a machine running <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">git</a> and a recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Node.js</a>. If you haven't yet installed our open source <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clever Tools</a> command line interface (CLI), type (with administrator rights on your system or <code>sudo</code> if necessary) :</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">npm i -g clever-tools
clever login</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once logged in, you can check that everything has gone correctly with the following command:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever profile</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's install Bun and create our first application:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">npm install -g bun
mkdir clevbun &amp;&amp; cd clevbun<br>bun init -y &amp;&amp; git init</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This will create a local git repository and a whole series of files, including <code>package.json</code> which contains your project's configuration. But also <code>index.ts</code> and <code>ts.config.json</code>, which are specific to the TypeScript language used by Bun by default. Don't worry, it handles simple JavaScript files just as well as <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/jsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JSX/TSX</a>, ECMAScript and CommonJS modules, which are imported <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/modules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a unified way</a>, <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/api/ffi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-level languages</a> or <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/api/sqlite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SQLite</a>. That's one of its strengths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's check that everything worked as planned:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">&gt; bun index.ts
Hello via Bun!</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An application using Bun's HTTP server</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our aim is to host a web application, so we're going to use an HTTP server. It's a good thing that Bun has its own, in addition to ensuring compatibility with Node.js functionalities and APIs. Developed using the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_(langage)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zig language</a>, using the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScriptCore</a> engine rather than v8, this runtime claims to be much more efficient for such uses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modify the contents of the <code>index.ts</code> file as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">Bun.serve({
  port: 8080,
  hostname: '0.0.0.0',
  fetch(req) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);
    if (url.pathname === "/") return new Response("Home page!");
    if (url.pathname === "/blog") return new Response("Blog!");
    return new Response("404!");
  },
  error(error) {
    return new Response(`&lt;pre&gt;${error}\n${error.stack}&lt;/pre&gt;`, {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "text/html",
      },
    });
  },
});</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This creates an HTTP server that sends a different response depending on the route (<code>url.pathname</code>) and a 404 error if none matches. If a problem occurs, a dedicated page will be displayed. Note that port 8080 is here specified in the code, but it could be defined with an environment variable: <code>$PORT</code>, <code>$BUN_PORT</code> or <code>$NODE_PORT</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clever deploy!</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now let's get down to the nitty-gritty of deploying on Clever Cloud, starting by preparing the application:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever create -t node clevbun
clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK "npm i -g bun"
clever env set CC_NODE_BUILD_TOOL "custom"
clever env set CC_CUSTOM_BUILD_TOOL "bun install"
clever env set CC_RUN_COMMAND "bun run index.ts"</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first command creates the application within your Clever Cloud account. Then we define environment variables for installing Bun within the image, followed by instructions for configuring dependencies and launching the project. As with Node.js, you can specify that an application is ready for production by assigning the value <code>production</code> to the <code>NODE_ENV</code> environment variable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is then available from our infrastructure and opened in your browser. Note that you can use this configuration to use Bun on a Node.js application already hosted by Clever Cloud by adapting <code>CC_RUN_COMMAND</code> to your project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that our application has been created, it can be deployed. It's as simple as a <code>git push</code>!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code {"className":"language-bash"} -->
<pre class="wp-block-code language-bash"><code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "First commit"
clever deploy &amp;&amp; clever open</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This should deploy the application on our infrastructure and open it in your browser. You can add <code>/blog</code> or <code>/random</code> at the end of the URL to check that routing works properly. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Many possibilities</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You don't have to worry about configuring HTTPS access, log collection or metrics - everything is already set up, accessible through Clever Tools or <a href="https://console.clever-cloud.com/">the Console</a>. You can also use the latter to activate <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/fr/blog/features/2021/10/28/grafana-pour-des-metriques-d-applications/">Grafana</a> in your account settings. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code class="language-bash">clever console</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other Clever Tools features let you assign it a domain, view its parameters and activity, modify the number and type of instances used, and stop or restart it. Take a look at our CLI help with <code>--help</code> or <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/tree/master#how-to-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its documentation</a> to find out more:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:code {"className":"language-bash"} -->
<pre class="wp-block-code language-bash"><code>clever domain
clever domain add domain.tld

clever status
clever activity

clever scale --min-instances 1 --max-instances 4 --min-flavor pico --max-flavor M
clever scale --instances 1 --flavor pico

clever restart
clever stop</code></pre>
<!-- /wp:code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, you can also go further with Bun and deploy applications using <a href="https://twitter.com/davlgd/status/1700478826755530822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Elysia web framework</a> or static site generators <a href="https://twitter.com/davlgd/status/1700599956359262313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as Astro</a>. We'll tell you all about that in future blog posts! Meanwhile, let us know what you expect from our JavaScript runtime images.</p>

<p>Nantes, September 18, 2023 - Clever Cloud, a French creator of solutions for deploying and hosting websites and applications in PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) mode, is pleased to announce <strong>the creation of a Cloud Diplomat position aimed at strengthening its ability to promote its technological vision and the technical interests of European cloud players</strong>. We have chosen to appoint J<strong>ean-Baptiste Piacentino</strong> to this position, who will bring to this mission his recognized expertise and commitment to open source and digital sovereignty.</p>

<p>The European cloud faces a number of challenges, including energy efficiency, industrial and political sovereignty, free competition and information systems security. Clever Cloud is convinced of <strong>the need for collective, ambitious responses to these challenges</strong>, based on a mutual understanding of technological solutions and the consequences of regulatory choices. Finding and adopting these answers can only be done through solid argumentation and consensus-building, to the benefit of everyone's interests. As part of Clever Cloud's Public Affairs department, the Cloud Diplomat will help to ensure the coherence and feasibility of the proposals put forward in various technical and regulatory discussion forums relating to the cloud, and will work with stakeholders to achieve these common goals.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2022/05/16/how-and-why-to-install-matomo-to-replace-google-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previous post</a>, we explained why you should switch from Google Analytics to Matomo for your audience measurement. Some of our customers have decided to take this step, and Clever Cloud has helped them get to grips with the solution. Based on this experience, find out in this article how to maximize the use of our Matomo addon on Clever Cloud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Selecting the optimal instance size</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as the Matomo addon is created, Clever Cloud deploys three optimized instances (a PHP runtime, a MySQL addon and a Redis addon). Initially, they are sized to the minimum server requirements in order to evolve according to your needs, thus ensuring cost optimization. If you need to make adjustments (for example, if you start to experience errors or slowdowns when launching some processes), our integrated Grafana is your best ally for monitoring your metrics and adjusting your resources accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Easy access to your metrics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to the intuitive dashboard for each application, you're provided with a clear view of it all. We've <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2023/03/16/a-metric-tile-to-simplify-application-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently integrated a metrics tile</a> into this dashboard, allowing you to track RAM and CPU consumption in real time from the console.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":8069,"sizeSlug":"medium","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-medium"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/08/capture-decran-2023-08-17-a-16-33-06.png" alt="Tile metrics from app Overview panel indicating CPU and RAM usage." class="wp-image-8069"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"34px"} -->
<div style="height:34px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a more in-depth analysis, a simple click on the Grafana logo from the tile gives you access to all your application's metrics. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8036,"width":493,"height":274,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/07/capture-decran-2023-07-31-a-15-27-32.png" alt="Metrics dashboard on Grafana for Matomo PHP application" class="wp-image-8036" style="width:493px;height:274px" width="493" height="274"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, Matomo's PHP instance logs are always there to provide you with additional information. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">All about auto-scalability</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-scalability on Clever Cloud is a major advantage, giving you peace of mind and flexible billing. With Matomo, this feature guarantees a smooth experience even in times of high demand. Keep in mind certain specifics, such as the occasional need for certain extensions, and you'll you make the most of this feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Perks from enabling auto-scalability on the PHP instance</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With auto-scalability, you can use Matomo smoothly and adaptively, even during peak periods! Benefit from powerful on-demand resources, while paying only for the consumption/second. Once you've completed your intensive tasks, your instance returns to an optimal size, guaranteeing efficiency and savings. So there's no need to reserve a large infrastructure to meet occasional needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">When to disable auto-scalability?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clever Cloud provides a service that can be adapted to your needs, with the option of limiting or completely disabling instance auto-scalability. In some cases, it may be advisable to deactivate it from time to time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Matomo is a managed service, some configuration options are unalterable to guarantee optimal operation and performance. As part of Matomo's continuous improvement, we have integrated the Google Analytics data import extension in response to common customer requests. This extension, generally used for a one-off migration from Google Analytics to Matomo, is deactivated by default.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you activate the extension and start importing data, and your application scales, your instance reboots and redeploys the application... with the default configurations. Restarting will therefore disable this extension and kill the import process at the same time. If you decide to use an extension that appears as disabled by default in our Matomo, we recommend the following procedure:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Disable auto-scalability for your Matomo PHP instance</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increase the instance size until the process is complete</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Restart instance</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Once the instance has been redeployed, activate the extension in Matomo</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you're ready to use the extension, which will remain active until the next server restart. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matomo, with its MySQL addon, is designed to grow with you. While the database is created with sufficient capacity at start-up, Matomo will quickly exploit its potential. To avoid surprises, why not set up Grafana alerts to monitor memory levels?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8034,"width":575,"height":281,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/07/grafana-mysql-1.png" alt="Database metrics on Grafana" class="wp-image-8034" style="width:575px;height:281px" width="575" height="281"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Your database metrics are also available in Grafana, in the Addon panel.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Creating alerts</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among its many features, Grafana lets you create alerts on the metrics of your choice. You'll find <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2021/12/03/slack-alerts-for-grafana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tutorial here</a> to show you how to create your alerts from Grafana to Slack, which you can also apply to other contact points like Discord, Teams, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend that you leave around 20% disk space available, as the MySQL instance will need disk to migrate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Migrating the database</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although scalability has its peculiarities for databases, Clever Cloud provides a smooth and intuitive manual solution. When you receive the alert, a simple connection to the Console on your MySQL addon dashboard will enable you to launch our one-click migration tool. This operation can take from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size of your database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Include a direct link to the migration tab in your Grafana alert message. This will give you instant access to the migration tool, making the process even easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging Matomo and Clever Cloud</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although a managed service is pre-configured, you have Matomo administrator status and can use it as such. Here are just a few examples of what you can do with Matomo and Clever Cloud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adding new Matomo users</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All our managed services use Clever Cloud SSO, enabling you to access deployed addons from your platform credentials. Perhaps you'd like to add users to Matomo without giving them access to the platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matomo lets you <a href="https://matomo.org/faq/general/user-roles-in-matomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add users with different levels of permissions</a> to the application. You can invite them by email directly from the Matomo interface. Users invited by this method will not have access to Matomo's system settings or extensions, unlike Clever Cloud users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Elevating permission levels</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have added a user from the Matomo interface, but now wish to add them to your Clever Cloud organization with the same email address, access to Matomo will be denied for security reasons, since this user already exists in the database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid duplication, simply delete the Matomo user from your database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Launch your MySQL addon's PHPMyAdmin interface</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Click on your database name (not schema)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Search by keyword <code>user</code> and choose the table <code>matomo_user</code></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Delete the user you wish to add to the Clever Cloud organization</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8038,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/07/phpmyadmin-1.png" alt="PHPMyAdmin Structure tab showing matomo_user table" class="wp-image-8038"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you can <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/account/organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invite the user to your organization with his email address</a>, giving him administration rights on the instance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Measure the audience of any application</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Clever Cloud, you can separate your collaborative environments by creating organizations to which you invite members. Organizations remain isolated, ensuring that no member has uninvited access to an organization's applications and addons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matomo makes it possible to track apps to which a simple script has been added to the head. So, even if an application is deployed within a different organization, Matomo offers a unified and complete view of its audience tracking as soon as the application contains this script.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8070,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/08/capture-decran-2023-08-17-a-16-35-05.png" alt="Matomo tracking code from its interface" class="wp-image-8070"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing role separation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can set up a dedicated organization for the Matomo administrator of your company or association. From this organization, the administrator can monitor the audience of applications hosted in other organizations, even if these are inaccessible to him/her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To implement this configuration, the administrator simply provides the appropriate script to be integrated into the head tag of each application. Once integrated, the tracking data will be visible in Matomo. This process ensures that developers have no access to Matomo, while restricting the Matomo administrator's access to applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">üì¢ New: Migrate Google Analytics data to Matomo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we mentioned, you can now use the extension to migrate your Google Analytics data to Matomo. It might be challenging to determine the right database sizing , due to Google Analytics' opacity regarding its metrics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this in mind, we suggest you keep an eye on your database metrics and opt for a gradual increase in storage capacity. To facilitate this procedure, Matomo provides <a href="https://matomo.org/faq/general/running-the-google-analytics-import/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a detailed guide to migration</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clever Cloud not only facilitates the deployment of on-demand applications and services in the form of add-ons. In addition, we include an integrated suite for all our customers, offering in-depth monitoring of application and database activity, as well as automatic and adaptive scaling capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you've opted for Matomo or one of our other add-ons, we're always listening to our customers' needs, so we can continually improve the services we offer. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Thanks to the intuitive dashboard for each application, you're provided with a clear view of it all. We've <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2023/03/16/a-metric-tile-to-simplify-application-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently integrated a metrics tile</a> into this dashboard, allowing you to track RAM and CPU consumption in real time from the console.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, Matomo's PHP instance logs are always there to provide you with additional information. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">All about auto-scalability</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-scalability on Clever Cloud is a major advantage, giving you peace of mind and flexible billing. With Matomo, this feature guarantees a smooth experience even in times of high demand. Keep in mind certain specifics, such as the occasional need for certain extensions, and you'll you make the most of this feature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Perks from enabling auto-scalability on the PHP instance</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With auto-scalability, you can use Matomo smoothly and adaptively, even during peak periods! Benefit from powerful on-demand resources, while paying only for the consumption/second. Once you've completed your intensive tasks, your instance returns to an optimal size, guaranteeing efficiency and savings. So there's no need to reserve a large infrastructure to meet occasional needs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">When to disable auto-scalability?</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clever Cloud provides a service that can be adapted to your needs, with the option of limiting or completely disabling instance auto-scalability. In some cases, it may be advisable to deactivate it from time to time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Matomo is a managed service, some configuration options are unalterable to guarantee optimal operation and performance. As part of Matomo's continuous improvement, we have integrated the Google Analytics data import extension in response to common customer requests. This extension, generally used for a one-off migration from Google Analytics to Matomo, is deactivated by default.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you activate the extension and start importing data, and your application scales, your instance reboots and redeploys the application... with the default configurations. Restarting will therefore disable this extension and kill the import process at the same time. If you decide to use an extension that appears as disabled by default in our Matomo, we recommend the following procedure:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Disable auto-scalability for your Matomo PHP instance</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Increase the instance size until the process is complete</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Restart instance</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Once the instance has been redeployed, activate the extension in Matomo</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you're ready to use the extension, which will remain active until the next server restart. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matomo, with its MySQL addon, is designed to grow with you. While the database is created with sufficient capacity at start-up, Matomo will quickly exploit its potential. To avoid surprises, why not set up Grafana alerts to monitor memory levels?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8034,"width":575,"height":281,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/07/grafana-mysql-1.png" alt="Database metrics on Grafana" class="wp-image-8034" style="width:575px;height:281px" width="575" height="281"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Your database metrics are also available in Grafana, in the Addon panel.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Creating alerts</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among its many features, Grafana lets you create alerts on the metrics of your choice. You'll find <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2021/12/03/slack-alerts-for-grafana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tutorial here</a> to show you how to create your alerts from Grafana to Slack, which you can also apply to other contact points like Discord, Teams, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend that you leave around 20% disk space available, as the MySQL instance will need disk to migrate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Migrating the database</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although scalability has its peculiarities for databases, Clever Cloud provides a smooth and intuitive manual solution. When you receive the alert, a simple connection to the Console on your MySQL addon dashboard will enable you to launch our one-click migration tool. This operation can take from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size of your database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Include a direct link to the migration tab in your Grafana alert message. This will give you instant access to the migration tool, making the process even easier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging Matomo and Clever Cloud</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although a managed service is pre-configured, you have Matomo administrator status and can use it as such. Here are just a few examples of what you can do with Matomo and Clever Cloud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adding new Matomo users</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All our managed services use Clever Cloud SSO, enabling you to access deployed addons from your platform credentials. Perhaps you'd like to add users to Matomo without giving them access to the platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matomo lets you <a href="https://matomo.org/faq/general/user-roles-in-matomo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add users with different levels of permissions</a> to the application. You can invite them by email directly from the Matomo interface. Users invited by this method will not have access to Matomo's system settings or extensions, unlike Clever Cloud users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Elevating permission levels</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have added a user from the Matomo interface, but now wish to add them to your Clever Cloud organization with the same email address, access to Matomo will be denied for security reasons, since this user already exists in the database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To avoid duplication, simply delete the Matomo user from your database.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Launch your MySQL addon's PHPMyAdmin interface</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Click on your database name (not schema)</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Search by keyword <code>user</code> and choose the table <code>matomo_user</code></li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Delete the user you wish to add to the Clever Cloud organization</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8038,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/07/phpmyadmin-1.png" alt="PHPMyAdmin Structure tab showing matomo_user table" class="wp-image-8038"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you can <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/account/organizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invite the user to your organization with his email address</a>, giving him administration rights on the instance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Measure the audience of any application</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Clever Cloud, you can separate your collaborative environments by creating organizations to which you invite members. Organizations remain isolated, ensuring that no member has uninvited access to an organization's applications and addons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matomo makes it possible to track apps to which a simple script has been added to the head. So, even if an application is deployed within a different organization, Matomo offers a unified and complete view of its audience tracking as soon as the application contains this script.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":8070,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/08/capture-decran-2023-08-17-a-16-35-05.png" alt="Matomo tracking code from its interface" class="wp-image-8070"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing role separation</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can set up a dedicated organization for the Matomo administrator of your company or association. From this organization, the administrator can monitor the audience of applications hosted in other organizations, even if these are inaccessible to him/her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To implement this configuration, the administrator simply provides the appropriate script to be integrated into the head tag of each application. Once integrated, the tracking data will be visible in Matomo. This process ensures that developers have no access to Matomo, while restricting the Matomo administrator's access to applications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">üì¢ New: Migrate Google Analytics data to Matomo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we mentioned, you can now use the extension to migrate your Google Analytics data to Matomo. It might be challenging to determine the right database sizing , due to Google Analytics' opacity regarding its metrics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this in mind, we suggest you keep an eye on your database metrics and opt for a gradual increase in storage capacity. To facilitate this procedure, Matomo provides <a href="https://matomo.org/faq/general/running-the-google-analytics-import/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a detailed guide to migration</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clever Cloud not only facilitates the deployment of on-demand applications and services in the form of add-ons. In addition, we include an integrated suite for all our customers, offering in-depth monitoring of application and database activity, as well as automatic and adaptive scaling capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether you've opted for Matomo or one of our other add-ons, we're always listening to our customers' needs, so we can continually improve the services we offer. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

<p>Dear customers,</p>



<p>Since we founded Clever Cloud in 2011, we&#8217;ve never changed our prices. For more than a decade (a record?), we&#8217;ve always preferred to optimize our costs and technologies so that you can enjoy both the highest quality services and the most competitive prices possible. We&#8217;re very proud to have achieved this, and to be able to count on your loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We wanted to maintain this pricing policy for as long as possible, but the general increase in prices from our suppliers &#8211; particularly energy suppliers, and more generally the very high inflation due to the international context, is not sparing Clever Cloud and our employees. It was no longer reasonable to maintain this policy of locked-in prices. We have therefore decided to modify our prices to ensure that we can continue to provide the level of service and support you expect, and to develop our infrastructure, features and new products that you will be using over the coming months.</p>



<p><a href="https://assets.clever-cloud.com/documents/cc-pricing-update062023.pdf">Our new pricing</a> structure also enables us to improve the overall consistency of our prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of you will see your bills drop, especially on higher-capacity plans. Conversely, you will find that the biggest increases are concentrated on certain managed services, in particular ElasticSearch instances, for which we are re-establishing consistency with our infrastructure costs and the rest of our catalog. The increase is much more limited for most PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB plans. Overall, we wanted to ensure a certain homogeneity in order to maintain competitive prices.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll note that Cellar (object storage) prices are currently unchanged. In fact, we&#8217;re working on a product enhancement that will enable us to improve service quality here too, while offering you more competitive rates, which will involve a reduction in its cost over the coming months. You will then be able to benefit from the economies of scale made possible by our investments in new infrastructures.</p>



<p>Our commitment remains unchanged: to guarantee the utmost transparency on our prices, and to provide you with the best possible predictability and control of your application hosting costs. Using Clever Cloud is FinOps by design. What&#8217;s more, by activating auto-scalability on your applications, you can automatically reduce the size and number of your virtual machines when they are less in demand, and thus adjust your invoices as closely as possible to your consumption needs, taking advantage of our per-second pricing model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new price scale will come into force on August 1, 2023, and will therefore apply automatically to invoices issued on or after September 1, 2023, with the exception of Enterprise contracts, which are subject to special conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If, as we hope, you decide to renew your contract, you don&#8217;t need to do anything to accept these new conditions &#8211; just continue to use Clever Cloud!</p>



<p>Our sales and technical support teams are at your disposal to help you optimize your choices and answer any questions you may have. Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact them.</p>

<p><strong>Nantes, April 6, 2023 </strong>- Clever Cloud is pleased to announce that as part of the implementation of the France 2030 plan, ministers Bruno Le Maire and Jean-No√´l Barrot have selected its application to benefit from the SecNumCloud qualification support scheme operated by Bpifrance in close collaboration with the Agence nationale de s√©curit√© des syst√®mes d‚Äôinformation (ANSSI) and the Direction G√©n√©rale des Entreprises (DGE). Obtaining the SecNumCloud qualification will enable Clever Cloud to <strong>offer the "trusted cloud"</strong> necessary to protect the sensitive data of public authorities and companies that wish to benefit from the best technical and legal guarantees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The implementation of this support system was desired by many players. It confirms the government's desire to help the French cloud industry meet its legitimate regulatory requirements, while continuing to invest primarily in the development and ongoing improvement of technological and commercial solutions expected by users.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an expert in hosting and maintaining applications and databases in operational conditions, <strong>Clever Cloud is delighted that the government is actively supporting the French cloud sector in this way</strong>, with 21 perfectly complementary projects that testify to the vitality of the French software industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clever Cloud is also one of the <strong>partners of the CollabNext</strong> consortium selected in the framework of the call for projects "Cloud collaborative office suites", which will make available a complete, sovereign, innovative, secure and interoperable collaborative platform. Clever Cloud's deployment and orchestration technologies will enable dynamic scaling, without service interruption, with strong optimisation of the resources used by the platform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"<em>These are very positive signals sent by the government to the entire French cloud industry, and I would particularly like to thank the ministers Bruno Le Maire and Jean-No√´l Barrot for this essential aid, which shows that the government believes in the capacity of the French industry to propose offers that meet market requirements. We will be able to respond to this expectation and to the confidence that has been shown in us</em>", declared Quentin ADAM, President of Clever Cloud.</p>

            <link>https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/features/2023/03/16/a-metric-tile-to-simplify-application-monitoring/</link>

            <description><![CDATA[<p></p><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hosting your sites through a service such as Clever Cloud is not just about sending your files to a server. It is gaining in simplicity of execution, in velocity, and more importantly, ensuring that they are kept in operating conditions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For each application or add-on deployed, you automatically get services such as backups, log management or metrics monitoring. So you can be assured that you are ready for production.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new metric tile</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This also includes a number of features that make it easy for you to access essential information through our <a href="https://console.clever-cloud.com/">Console</a>. Among its recent improvements, we added a new "tile" in the overview of each of your applications:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":7864,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"media"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/03/overview-en.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cdn.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2023/03/overview-en.png" alt="Dashboard Metric tile" class="wp-image-7864"/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here you will find the vCPU and memory usage over a 24-hour period, in the form of a graph with 24 bars, each representing one hour. An average value is also displayed, corresponding to the last hour.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A three-level color scheme allows you to instantly identify a situation that needs your attention, or to make sure that everything is fine. An information panel explains how the elements are working and you have shortcuts to more complete metrics or to the Grafana dashboard related to your application.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if you don't want to have to worry about the load level of your application and want to feel more peaceful, think about activating the auto-scalability. It allows you to constantly increase or decrease the size or number of your instances as needed, while respecting the limits you defined.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A convenient and accessible web component</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/clever-components/?path=/story/%F0%9F%9B%A0-overview-cc-tile-metrics--default-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this tile has been developed as <strong>a Web Component</strong>, documented here</a>, that you can freely use. It is also <strong>the first one to follow our accessibility rules</strong>, from buttons and links to screen reader handling: it will feature a table for the graphic.</p>
