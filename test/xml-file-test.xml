<p class="has-drop-cap">The year 2021 was marked by the arrival of the covid 19 vaccine. A hope for many, announcing the end of this pandemic that will have marked the beginning of our century. Haha. Well, actually, no. On the eve of the year 2022, we discover the fascinating capacity of the variant named Omicron to spread. Vaccination campaigns then resume, to inoculate the so-called &#8220;booster&#8221; doses to stem this new wave of contamination.</p>



<h2>Hey, we&#8217;d like to help</h2>



<p>At Clever Cloud we are trying to act &#8211; in our own way &#8211; in the face of the situation. As was the case previously with <a href="https://makair.life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Makair</a> (the respirator co-designed by our CEO Quentin Adam), for example. And, at the beginning of the school year 2021, we came across the Covidtracker teams almost by chance. They were in the middle of working on Vite Ma Dose. This was an opportunity to discuss their needs. And since the beginning of the fall 2021, we have been providing instances for the algorithms of the Vite Ma Dose. To goal is to detect vaccination appointments.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With the ViteMaDose volunteer team, we are investing our time to serve a vaccination campaign that we believe is essential for our fellow citizens. Fortunately, we are not the only ones: several French public services and companies have also lent a hand to the product by contributing the know-how of their teams or access to their technology. This is the case of CleverCloud, which has generously offered to help us by hosting the core of the product: the algorithm for finding vaccination slots for covid-19. </p><cite>Florent Jaby</cite></blockquote>



<h2>A short story of migration</h2>



<p>We are delighted to be able to help the Vite Ma Dose teams today. We provide the <a href="/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessary resources</a> to enable the service to function properly. As much as the frontend is quite simple, the backend, which aggregates appointments from a small number of different platforms, is a different story.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Clever Cloud offered us hosting specific to our needs and our architecture thanks to its managed Gitlab Runner offer. We were able to entrust them with all of the operational complexity of the platform, which otherwise required our constant attention, not always possible in a voluntary capacity. This also frees up our time for other matters such as the progress of the 3rd dose of vaccination or the vaccination of the youngest children, which are changing daily. In fact, the migration to the Clever Cloud runner was completed in a weekend, painlessly and perfectly as planned.</p><cite>Florent Jaby</cite></blockquote>



<p>Today, the service is running like clockwork. We congratulate the Covidtracker and Vite Ma Dose teams for their efforts.</p>

<p>Christmas is next week and you probably heard about the “Secret Santa” tradition. <strong>Loïck Piera</strong>, Web Consultant at JoliCode, developed <strong>an app called Secret Santa </strong>to help you organise yours with your colleagues, friends or family. Secret Santa has been <strong>hosted by Clever Cloud since 2018</strong>.</p>



<h2><strong>What is a Secret Santa?</strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a <strong>Christmas tradition</strong> where <strong>each person of the group is randomly assigned someone</strong> to offer a gift to, and nobody knows the author of the gift they will receive until the D-day. </p>



<h2><strong>How does the app work?</strong></h2>



<p>It allows you to <strong>simplify the organization of your Secret Santa</strong>. How? By automating the assignment of a person to whom to offer a gift for each participant. The application can be connected to <strong>Slack</strong> or <strong>Discord</strong> and now a <strong>beta</strong> <strong>version for Zoom</strong> is also available.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="667" height="370" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/12/secret-santa-slack-sample-667x370.png" alt="secret-santa-slack-sample" class="wp-image-4368" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/secret-santa-slack-sample-667x370.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/secret-santa-slack-sample-318x176.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/secret-santa-slack-sample-768x426.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/secret-santa-slack-sample.png 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption>Slack message from the Secret Santa Bot</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2><strong>How to install Secret Santa?</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Go to <a href="https://secret-santa.team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their website</a>, then <strong>choose the application</strong> to which you want to connect Secret Santa.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="667" height="70" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-16.05.07-667x70.png" alt="installer-secret-santa" class="wp-image-4365" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-16.05.07-667x70.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-16.05.07-318x33.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-16.05.07-768x81.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-16.05.07.png 1506w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption>Applications compatible with Secret Santa</figcaption></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>Select the group members </strong>you would like to add to the participants. At this step, you can also <strong>set-up a personalized message </strong>to send to each participant.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="667" height="399" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-19.26.02-e1639074482229-667x399.png" alt="select-participants-secret-santa" class="wp-image-4372" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-19.26.02-e1639074482229-667x399.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-19.26.02-e1639074482229-318x190.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-19.26.02-e1639074482229-768x459.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/12/Capture-decran-2021-12-09-a-19.26.02-e1639074482229.png 1335w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption>Selecting the participants</figcaption></figure></div>



<ul><li>Then, everything is set, the app shuffles and <strong>assign each participant to another one</strong> and send the message you previously set-up. All you need to do now is to buy the gift for the person you have been assigned to!&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Why did Secret Santa choose Clever Cloud?</strong></h2>



<p>We asked Loïck Piera, the Web Consultant at JoliCode which developed the app, <strong>what he thinks about the solution we provide</strong>. This is what he replied: </p>



<p><strong>Clever Cloud </strong>: <em>&#8220;What are the main assets that made you choose Clever Cloud?&#8221;</em></p>



<p><strong>Loïck Piera </strong>: <em>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a <strong>solid platform</strong> which operates without having to overthink it and with <strong>no need of maintenance from our side</strong>. <strong>It&#8217;s simple and fast</strong> to deploy in production, <strong>and there is no service interruption</strong>, which is crucial. Secret Santa is a Symfony application with PHP 8 and the Clever Cloud infrastructure<strong> fits our needs </strong>perfectly.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><strong>Clever Cloud </strong>: <em>&#8220;What do you appreciate the most in our solution?&#8221;</em></p>



<p><strong><strong>Loïck</strong> Piera </strong>: <em>&#8220;What we appreciate the most in this hosting solution, is <em>the <strong>simplicity of use</strong></em>. We only have to indicate the webroot directory, and that&#8217;s all, the version of PHP and the Composer dependencies are detected&nbsp;automatically! There is also an <strong>interesting list of addons</strong>. Clever Cloud is </em><strong><em>a platform really adapted to most web projects</em></strong><em>.</em>&#8220;</p>

<h2>What is Log4Shell?</h2>



<p>You probably heard about Log4Shell (or CVE-2021-44228), the vulnerability which impacted log4j, a famous log library written in Java. </p>



<p>This <strong>critical</strong> vulnerability allows to remotely execute code on the servers of a company or to display the environment variables of an application.</p>



<h2>What has been implemented at Clever Cloud?</h2>



<p>At Clever Cloud, we worked all weekend to resolve this issue.</p>



<p>All our Elasticsearch add-ons were secured quickly, <s>and many of our customers are secured by the most recent versions of JDK</s>. Edit (13/12 16:41 UTC+1) : Even the most recent versions of Java are now vulnerable to RCE (Remote Code Execution) due to a bypass. <strong>The only viable solution is to patch and update log4j directly.</strong></p>



<p>Please also note : </p>



<ul><li>Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.17.0.</li><li>Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2.</li><li>Otherwise, remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath in a <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/develop/build-hooks/#post-build-cc_post_build_hook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post build hook</a> (you have to execute the hook in the file where the log4j jar is): </li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK=zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class "</code></pre>



<p>For the others, we have initiated a thorough monitoring and analysis policy.</p>



<p><s>We are also in the process of updating the Java image with the following <strong>Log4j configuration property</strong>:</s> Edit&nbsp;(14/12&nbsp;14:04 UTC+1) : The Java image has successfully be updated and <strong>all Java applications have been redeployed with the following Log4j</strong> <strong>configuration property</strong>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code></pre>



<p>Please note that <strong>this flag only work on versions superior or equal to Log4j v2.10.0.</strong></p>



<p>We upgraded the <strong>New Relic Java Agent to the 7.4.1 version</strong> and the apps on which the agent was deployed have been redeployed.</p>



<p>We also patched the <strong>Pulsar cluster</strong>. </p>



<h2>How to mitigate the risks?</h2>



<p>We urge you to <strong>update your dependency to <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Log4j v2.17.0</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Then, depending on the environments and add-ons you work with, here&#8217;s what you can do as well:</p>



<h2>For Docker</h2>



<p>If you are using Docker, you can do either :</p>



<ul><li>Update to Log4j v2.17.0 (recommended)</li><li>Or setup the following Log4j (<strong>v2.10.0 minimum</strong> only) configuration property: <code>log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true</code> </li></ul>



<h2>For Jenkins</h2>



<p>The Jenkins security team has confirmed that Log4j is not used in Jenkins core. However, it can be used in some Jenkins plugins. You can identify if Log4j is included in a plugin by using the following command in the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/script-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Script Console</a>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup.class.protectionDomain.codeSource</code></pre>



<h2>Support team</h2>



<p>Of course, our <strong>support team remains available</strong> if you have any question regarding the current situation. You can reach them via the chat or send an e-mail at <strong>support@clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io</strong>. </p>

<p>In one of our previous posts, we announced the <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/features/2021/10/28/a-grafana-to-plot-applications-metrics/">release of a dedicated Clever Cloud Grafana</a> for all <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/administrate/metrics/overview/#publish-your-own-metrics">our metrics.</a> What if now, you want to receive an <strong>alert</strong> when an application is in an <strong>abnormal</strong> state? Grafana provides an alerting service that is compatible with our Warp10 backend. Let’s see how we can create Slack alerts with our or any Grafana with a <code>PromQL</code> data source. </p>



<h2>Grafana Notifier</h2>



<p>First, before creating any alerts, we need to configure a Grafana notifier. You can have a full list of supported Grafana notifier <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/old-alerting/notifications/#list-of-supported-notifiers">here</a>. However, you won&#8217;t be able to configure notifiers that require an admin access, like email or SMTP. In this example, we will configure a slack channel to receive all Grafana alerts.</p>



<h3>Configure Slack</h3>



<p>To be able to receive alerts on Slack, Grafana will ask for a web hook. The process to create one with slack is <a href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks">here</a>. At the end you should obtain an active incoming web hook.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="729" height="975" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/webHookSlack.png" alt="Slack incoming webhook" class="wp-image-4169" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/webHookSlack.png 729w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/webHookSlack-160x214.png 160w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/webHookSlack-334x447.png 334w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /><figcaption>Slack incoming webhook</figcaption></figure>



<p>Simply copy the web hook URL and then go to the alerting main panel (bell on the left) and add a new <strong>slack</strong> <code>notification channel</code>. Configure it as done below, within the field <code>web hook URL</code>, the one from the slack application. You can set your own custom name.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="738" height="1298" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/Slack_notifier.png" alt="Add a slack notification channel" class="wp-image-4168" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Slack_notifier.png 738w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Slack_notifier-122x214.png 122w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Slack_notifier-254x447.png 254w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /><figcaption>Add a Slack notification channel</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before you validate, you can test your slack integration with the <code>Test</code> button. Without delay, in the configure slack channel, you will receive a test message.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2121" height="462" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message.png" alt="Slack notification test message" class="wp-image-4170" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message.png 2121w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message-318x69.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message-667x145.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message-768x167.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message-1536x335.png 1536w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Test_Slack_Message-2048x446.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2121px) 100vw, 2121px" /><figcaption>Slack notification test message</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Grafana Alerting</h2>



<p>Now that we have enabled an alert notifier, let’s create an alert in Grafana. </p>



<h3>Clever Cloud Available Metrics </h3>



<p>We will start from one of the template dashboards we release with Grafana. We deployed a preview application on a Clever Cloud organisation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2383" height="1282" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/Application.png" alt="Custom application Clever Cloud dashboard" class="wp-image-4171" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Application.png 2383w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Application-318x171.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Application-667x359.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Application-768x413.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Application-1536x826.png 1536w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Application-2048x1102.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2383px) 100vw, 2383px" /><figcaption>Custom application Clever Cloud dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<p>For the rest of this post, we will work on the <code>load average</code> metrics. As we can see below, it’s a simple PromQL query. However, it includes custom dashboard variables&nbsp;<code>APP_ID</code> and <code>DEPLOY_ID</code> that <strong>are not supported in Grafana alerting</strong>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2027" height="907" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png" alt="Runtime load graph" class="wp-image-4172" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard.png 2027w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard-318x142.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard-667x298.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard-768x344.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Dashboard-1536x687.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2027px) 100vw, 2027px" /><figcaption>Runtime load graph</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before enabling the alerting,  we will keep somewhere this graph query <code>system.load1_per_cpu{app_id="APP_ID"}</code>. I will only replace the variable <code>APP_ID</code> by its value, which is available on top of the dashboard. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="542" height="103" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/Runtime_ID.png" alt="Runtime ID" class="wp-image-4173" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Runtime_ID.png 542w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Runtime_ID-318x60.png 318w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" /><figcaption>Runtime ID</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then in order not to have our custom alerts removed at each update of the Clever Cloud dashboard templates, create a new dashboard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="864" height="595" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/Create-ne-Dashboard.png" alt="Create new dashboard" class="wp-image-4174" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Create-ne-Dashboard.png 864w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Create-ne-Dashboard-311x214.png 311w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Create-ne-Dashboard-649x447.png 649w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/Create-ne-Dashboard-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /><figcaption>Create new dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<p>Also save it in a dedicated dashboard which is not <code>Clever Cloud</code>, in our example, it’s <code>alerting</code>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="501" height="353" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/SaveDashboard.png" alt="Save new dashboard" class="wp-image-4175" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/SaveDashboard.png 501w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/SaveDashboard-304x214.png 304w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><figcaption>Save new dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, in this new dashboard create the same load graph with the query <code>system.load1_per_cpu{app_id="APP_ID"}</code>. As well as seen previously replace APP_ID by your own application ID. For the data source, select the <code>PromQL</code> one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2036" height="1017" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/TestAlertDashQuery.png" alt="Load application alert Graph" class="wp-image-4176" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestAlertDashQuery.png 2036w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestAlertDashQuery-318x159.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestAlertDashQuery-667x333.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestAlertDashQuery-768x384.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestAlertDashQuery-1536x767.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2036px) 100vw, 2036px" /><figcaption>Load application alert Graph</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Set Up The Alerting</h3>



<p>At this instant we have a new graph where we can set up a first alert on the load of our application. For that, go on the <code>Alert</code> panel, and configure the alert based on the parameter you want. Quickly, to get an alert working, I set up the condition to check if my metrics <strong>are below</strong> the value&nbsp;<code>0.2</code>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2029" height="1128" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/CreateFirstAlert.png" alt="Alert conditions section" class="wp-image-4177" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/CreateFirstAlert.png 2029w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/CreateFirstAlert-318x177.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/CreateFirstAlert-667x371.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/CreateFirstAlert-768x427.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/CreateFirstAlert-1536x854.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2029px) 100vw, 2029px" /><figcaption>Alert conditions section</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then still on the <code>Alert</code> panel add the notifier you created in the first section. Here, you can customise the alert you will receive in slack: adding a message and custom tags.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="396" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/NotificationGrafana.png" alt="Alert notifier section" class="wp-image-4179" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/NotificationGrafana.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/NotificationGrafana-318x164.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/NotificationGrafana-667x344.png 667w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Alert notifier section</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you have set up your alert, you can test the rule with the <code>test rule</code> button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="761" height="746" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/TestingAlertRule.png" alt="Test rule result" class="wp-image-4178" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestingAlertRule.png 761w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestingAlertRule-218x214.png 218w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/TestingAlertRule-456x447.png 456w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /><figcaption>Test rule result</figcaption></figure>



<p>Next all you have to do is to wait for an alert to appear on Slack! Besides each alert state change will be ploted on the alert graph. After about five minutes, as I was clearly matching my alert state condition, I got two states change: one pending and one alerting. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2185" height="837" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2.png" alt="Alert states" class="wp-image-4180" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2.png 2185w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2-318x122.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2-667x256.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2-768x294.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2-1536x588.png 1536w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/FirstAlertV2-2048x785.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2185px) 100vw, 2185px" /><figcaption>Alert states</figcaption></figure>



<p>As soon as the alert state happens, a slack message is sent through the notifier. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="936" height="770" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/11/AlertInSlack.png" alt="Slack alert test message" class="wp-image-4181" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/AlertInSlack.png 936w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/AlertInSlack-260x214.png 260w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/AlertInSlack-543x447.png 543w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/11/AlertInSlack-768x632.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /><figcaption>Slack alert test message</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, I would like to retrieve a more ‘normal’ state. To do it, I update my alert condition and set it to<strong> above</strong> <code>0.8</code>, which is a more classical value for an alert threshold for the load metrics. </p>

<p>Instantly or almost, the state of the alert should change and comes <strong>OK</strong>!</p>

<h2>To Sum Up</h2>



<p>You should now be able to configure your own alerts on Slack for Grafana! You can play with the pending time, the alert condition, when to trigger the alert, the alert message the tags and so on. In fact, all you need is a working <code>PromQL</code> query. Nonetheless remember that the Grafana alerting doesn’t support dashboard variables. Other than that, you should be able to custom the alert as you wish! </p>



<p>I hope you enjoy and feel free to share with us your thought on the Alerting and the Metrics product. We will be happy to have your feedback. You can contact me directly on twitter, or send us a message through the <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/administrate/metrics/overview/#comments">metrics overview comments</a>.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">At Clever Cloud, we think it’s important to offer <strong>access</strong> to <strong>our metrics</strong> for our users. That’s why you can already query all our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/administrate/metrics/overview/">metrics</a>, and can choose between WarpScript or <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2021/10/12/enabling-promql-queries-with-erlenmeyer/">PromQL</a>. Besides, we wanted to provide <strong>more than only a metrics access</strong> to our users! We wanted to give a tool that will make you able to <strong>explore</strong> and <strong>visualize</strong> the state of your Clever Cloud applications. Internally, we’re using <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> a lot to build monitoring dashboards, what if we can re-use this tool and build <strong>dedicated</strong> <strong>dashboards</strong>? That’s how we got the idea to release a <strong>Grafana for all of you</strong>!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://static-assets.cellar.services.clever-cloud.com/logos/grafana.svg" alt="Grafana logo"/><figcaption>Grafana</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In this blog post, we will talk about the <strong>Grafana tool</strong>. Then we will see how we <strong>deployed</strong> it. After that we will detail all actions to do to activate our <strong>Grafana Beta</strong> on your organisation. We will conclude with our <strong>dashboard’s contents</strong>.</p>



<h2>About Grafana</h2>



<p><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> is an <strong>open-source</strong> tool which enables among others metrics, alerting or log visualization. Thus Grafana’s aim is to ease to create <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2019/05/16/worth-a-look-public-grafana-dashboards/">efficient dashboards</a>. Grafana also comes with multiple kinds of <strong>tiles</strong> or <strong>themes</strong> and provide <strong>many data sources</strong>. In our case, we will use only <a href="https://github.com/ovh/ovh-warp10-datasource">Warp10</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/">Prometheus</a>.</p>



<h3>Grafana at Clever Cloud</h3>



<p>For the one who wants to utilize Grafana, it&#8217;s easy to deploy it today on Clever Cloud. For the French reader you can follow this <a href="https://blog.kbdev.io/dev/2021/08/24/grafana-clevercloud.html">blog post</a>. And also we released some scripts to automate it on <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/grafana-example">Github</a>. When we wanted to deploy a Grafana for our customers, we decided to re-use the same scripts. This is why our deployed instance runs as a Clever Cloud runtime application. We only activate an option as <code>force https</code> and add some <code>scalability</code>.</p>



<h3>Our Grafana Architecture</h3>



<p>As Clever Cloud, Grafana furnishes organisation too. Then it’s easy to <strong>link both</strong> and make it available to our users. Next, we created an API endpoint to connect our Grafana to our console. All <strong>data sources</strong> exposed (Warp10 and Prometheus) are <strong>handled on our side. This means that no users can change them</strong>. However we <strong>cyclically</strong> <strong>refresh</strong> all <strong>tokens</strong>. In the same way, we regularly update all custom dashboards we provide. </p>



<p>Everyone<strong> </strong>features<strong> editor rights</strong> in their organisations. This means that you can customise all dashboards as you want. We will see, later in this post, how to not generates conflicts with our templates.</p>



<h2>Activate the Grafana Beta Organisation</h2>



<p>To activate our beta, you need to go to your Clever Cloud organisation view in the Clever Cloud console. Then you will have access to a page called <code>Metrics in Grafana</code>.</p>



<h3>Available Dashboards</h3>



<p>We built three unique dashboards for you! First we will start by a tour of an organisation metrics. Then we will get more into the details of a runtime view. And finally we will see what we bring for the add-ons. <strong>Most graph of all Grafana dashboards contains a small information tile. There, you can retrieve a bit of help and description</strong>.</p>



<h4>Clever Cloud Organisation</h4>



<p>The organisation view is the <strong>home</strong> <strong>dashboard</strong> in Grafana. It provides some <strong>insights</strong> about your organisation. Here, we expose some key information about the applications, the flavours and the image types. Besides, as a home, you will access some links here. You can go to all Clever Cloud template dashboards as well as the ones you set as <strong>favourite</strong> in Grafana. You can also find out direct link to reach an application.</p>



<p>A tile I want to explain a bit more is the deployment <strong>state graph</strong>. What is done on this tile? Every <strong>new</strong> <strong>deployment</strong> generates a new state. We plot only each one occurring during the Grafana time range. And finally this dashboard includes a metrics counting the average <strong>requests rate</strong> per minutes, computed from the access logs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://static-assets.cellar.services.clever-cloud.com/grafana/screens/home.png" alt="Grafana home dashboard"/><figcaption>Grafana home dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Application Runtime Dashboard</h4>



<p>I will now introduce the runtime dashboard. In this dashboard we retrieve several parts. First we start with a quick overview of your <strong>application</strong> <strong>state</strong>. Then we will have access to more details sections. Those sections will be about classical system metrics as the CPU, the load, the memory, the disks and the networks. Moreover in each segment, you will find many graphs as the <strong>usage</strong> or when the <strong>resource</strong> <strong>is</strong> <strong>saturated</strong>. To compute this last metrics, we apply a linear regression.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://static-assets.cellar.services.clever-cloud.com/grafana/screens/runtime.png" alt="Grafana runtime dashboard"/><figcaption>Grafana runtime dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Add-on Dashboard</h4>



<p>The last dashboard contains the add-on metrics view. A first panel contains <strong>system</strong>&#8211;<strong>related</strong> metrics as the CPU, the memory, the disks or the network. A second one show the <strong>database</strong> metrics. This is where you will retrieve data as connections count, transactions, errors, deadlocks or tuple operations. However we collect custom data on a limited pool of add-on. This means there are only four of them: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis and MongoDB.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://static-assets.cellar.services.clever-cloud.com/grafana/screens/addon.png" alt="Grafana add-on dashboard" width="840" height="472"/><figcaption>Grafana add-on dashboard</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Customize Your Grafana Organisation</h2>



<p>You have full right to <strong>edit</strong> all dashboard saved in your Grafana organisation. This means you can edit our templates. However we will update them every once in a while. As a result all your dashboards will always be up to date. </p>



<p>We store all our templates on the <code>Clever Cloud</code> folder. However, you can create custom dashboards <strong>anywhere else</strong>, we will never update them! </p>



<p>The Grafana <code>manage view</code> lists all folders and files. Besides, this view is helpful to <strong>organise</strong> and to <strong>create</strong> new folders!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1148" height="634" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/10/Manage_Grafana.png" alt="Grafana manage view" class="wp-image-3832" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/10/Manage_Grafana.png 1148w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/10/Manage_Grafana-318x176.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/10/Manage_Grafana-667x368.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/10/Manage_Grafana-768x424.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1148px) 100vw, 1148px" /><figcaption>Grafana manage view</figcaption></figure>



<p>At any time you can <strong>reset</strong> our templates. For example in case you made unwanted changes. In that case, you can reach the Grafana page of your Clever Cloud organisation. Then click on <code>reset all dashboards</code>. Finally, all <code>Clever Cloud</code> ones will be back to their initial states.</p>



<h2>Share Your Experience</h2>



<p>Thank you for <strong>reading</strong> this post, we will be more than happy to get some feedback! How do you use our available data? Is there something missing for your use case on what we have provided? I hope you will enjoy this new data ride!</p>

<p>At Clever Cloud we aim to provide the best services for all kinds of data. Time Series data are no exception to this. We&#8217;re thrilled to announce a time series database, TARDIS, in the next few weeks.</p>



<p><span id="more-3723"></span></p>



<h2>About TARDIS Features</h2>



<p>A Time Series Database (TSDB) store series of chronological data, in an optimised way. The use cases are numerous:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><strong>Time Series</strong></strong> and <strong>Signal processing</strong> : TARDIS will be able to store your metrics and states. It will also offer an interactive and analytical queryable store to monitor changes over time.</li>
<li><strong>BI &amp; Analytics</strong> : You can use TARDIS as an analytical solution for Time Series. It will power Time Series analytical queries as well as dashboards. We are planning 3rd party integration too.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: TARDIS will help you to integrate KPIs from a specialised service.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Technology &amp; Supported Protocols</h3>



<p>This TSDB will be backed by our partner <a href="https://senx.io">SenX</a>, the company behind <a href="https://www.warp10.io">Warp10</a>, on a distributed infrastructure backed by OVHcloud.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting news about TARDIS is its ability to be a polyglot TSDB and to support multiple query languages and protocols. For instance, you can push your data with <strong>Prometheus</strong>, and you can retrieve it with <strong>WarpScript</strong> or <strong>PromQL</strong>. It’s the same data, without duplication.</p>
<p>The architecture uses proxies (hosted and managed by Clever Cloud) that bridges the gap between Warp10 and various requests protocols, <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2021/10/12/enabling-promql-queries-with-erlenmeyer/">similar to our metrics backend</a>.</p>



<h3>Reliability FTW</h3>



<p>TARDIS stores data in a <strong>strongly consistent fashion</strong>, thanks to a transactional pipeline. So, we won’t lose any data once a push is acknowledged.</p>





<p>Regarding <strong>high availability</strong>, we operate a special care for the storage too. Namely, rack awareness optimisations, network topology fault isolation and data placements.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We’ve designed everything in TARDIS for very <strong>high scalability</strong>. We clocked this technology with production workloads with millions data points per second, and over a billion unique series for a single region.</p>



<h3>Pay as You Go</h3>



<p>TARDIS only bills for what users use. It start at 5 millions points (perfect for an app that produce 100 data points every minute, during a month). We will release the final pricing within the next few days. We will propose a beta program at a relatively low price first. Then the stabilised product pricing will change a bit, still at a competitive level (as always!).</p>





<h3>Integrated Authentication</h3>



<p>TARDIS will be integrated with Clever Cloud IAM, as it is with our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/pulsar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Pulsar</a> and <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/elasticsearch-hosting/">Elasticsearch</a> services. In the meantime, we provide crypto tokens that let users define read or write access, to their entire data set or subscope to specific labels.</p>





<h3>Deletion &amp; GDPR</h3>



<p>TARDIS complies with GDPR by allowing customers to delete their data. Deletes can occur on a single data point, a whole series, or a set of series, over a specified time range. Which is particularly useful nowadays. To learn more about this, <a href="https://www.warp10.io/content/03_Documentation/03_Interacting_with_Warp_10/07_Deleting_data">check the documentation</a>. </p>





<h2>Release date and beta program</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re planning  the public release by the end of the 2021. But we can provide the service in advance as of today. You can reach us via the following form :</p>

<p>Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software.<span id="more-3519"></span> It facilitates continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), is highly configurable and benefits from a huge community as well as many online resources.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3691"><img title="Jenkins Dashboard on Clever Cloud" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-09-30-at-19-37-38-Console-Clever-Cloud-1.png" alt="Jenkins Dashboard on Clever Cloud"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3691" class="wp-caption-text">Jenkins Dashboard on Clever Cloud</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Clever Cloud applications to run your jobs</h3>
<p>Customise your Jenkins with to the huge variety of available Jenkins plugins: you can install and update any plugin you need to customise your jobs in the best possible ways. We also provide our own custom plugin to manage the runners that will execute your jobs. It means that tasks won&#8217;t be executed on the Jenkins controller instance but in dedicated virtual machines deployed on Clever Cloud infrastructure. This allows you to configure the Docker image to use with all the tools you need, and the size of the virtual machine that would suit your jobs. The minimum size is <strong>XS (1 vCPU, 2 GiB RAM)</strong> and the maximum is a <strong>3XL (16 vCPU, 32 GiB RAM).</strong> If you need bigger runner sizes for your jobs, let us know!</p>
<p>There are no limits in the number of jobs you can run, either in parallel or in total, you can start as many jobs as you need. Each job will only be billed for the time it really took, down to the second.</p>
<h3>Enhance your Clever Cloud deployments workflow</h3>
<p>Clever Cloud Jenkins add-ons can enhance your deployment workflow on Clever Cloud. For example, if you wish to automatically deploy your project once all tests are successful, you can configure your job to install our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/reference/clever-tools/getting_started/">CLI clever-tools</a> and then push your code to your Clever Cloud application.</p>
<p>Here is a Jenkinsfile example on how you could achieve this. It uses multiple stages to install clever-tools and start the deployment of your default application. Clever-tools will automatically pick up the secrets in the environment variables defined in <code>CLEVER_TOKEN</code> and <code>CLEVER_SECRET</code> to be authenticated. You will need to create two Jenkins credentials with actual tokens. Tokens can be easily retrieved on your local machine by looking in <code>~/.config/clever-cloud</code> on Linux and Mac OSX and <code>%APPDATA%/clever-cloud</code> on Windows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">pipeline {
  environment {
    CLEVER_TOKEN = credentials('CLEVER_TOKEN')
    CLEVER_SECRET = credentials('CLEVER_SECRET')
  }

  stage('clever-tools') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'npm install -g clever-tools'
       }
     }
  }

  stage('tests') {
    // Your tests steps
  }

  stage('deployment') {
    steps {
      script {
        // Deploy the application
        // A .clever.json file must exists in the repository
        sh 'clever deploy'
      }
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>You can also use Jenkins&#8217;s own environment variables to customise your build. You can get a list of those variables by appending <code>/env-vars.html</code> at the end of your add-on&#8217;s URL. Using those, you could decide whether to deploy on your staging or production application based on the branch name.</p>
<h3>Built with the classic features you love</h3>
<p>As with any other products we release, Jenkins add-ons have <strong>automatic backups</strong>, <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>logs</strong> and <strong>encryption at rest</strong>. You will also be able to use Clever Cloud <strong>Single Sign-On</strong> to connect to your Jenkins add-on, meaning that every organization member can access the Jenkins instance under its own account.</p>
<p>You can find more information about how to configure Jenkins <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/jenkins/">in our documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p><script type="module" src="https://components.clever-cloud.com/load.js?version=7&amp;lang=en&amp;components=cc-pricing-product.smart-addon,cc-pricing-product.smart-runtime"></script></p>
<p>You will find below the pricing of both <strong>Jenkins</strong> and <strong>Jenkins Runners</strong>. The <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/pricing#https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/pricing#jenkins">pricing page</a> is here to help you estimate various configurations.</p>

<div slot="head"></div>
<p></cc-pricing-product></cc-smart-container></div>
<h3 id="whats-next">What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>We plan to provide an even better integration with Jenkins. Our next goals are to add multiple runner retention policies (having successive jobs on the same runner) in addition to improve boot time of runners. We will also open source our Jenkins plugin and upstream it to the Jenkins plugins repository. That way, we will bring the ability to start&nbsp;your own Clever Cloud Jenkins runners from your self-hosted Jenkins instance.</p>

<div>
<div>To simplify the adoption of Warp10, the OVHcloud Metrics team built the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ovh/erlenmeyer">Erlenmeyer</a></strong> tool. In the first place, this tool enables the use of <strong>several open source protocols</strong> as PromQL, OpenTSDB, InfluxQL or Graphite to query Warp10 stored metrics.</div>
<div>Secondly, Erlenmeyer works as a proxy in front of a Warp10 cluster. Then we deployed a couple of Erlenmeyer instances in front of our Warp10 infrastructure, naturally providing new ways to query your application metrics.</div>
</div>
<blockquote><p>In this post, we will review what Erlenmeyer brings and how to handle Clever Cloud services metrics with <strong>PromQL</strong>.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Erlenmeyer protocols</h2>
<div>
<div>Erlenmeyer almost entirely enables <a href="https://www.ovh.com/blog/erlenmeyer-and-promql-compatibility/">PromQL queries</a>, OpenTSDB, InfluxQL and some of the Graphite functions. Moreover, you can retrieve the documentation about each protocol implementation and usage on Erlenmeyer&#8217;s GitHub:</div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ovh/erlenmeyer/blob/master/doc/promql.md">PromQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ovh/erlenmeyer/blob/master/doc/openTSDB.md">OpenTSDB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ovh/erlenmeyer/blob/master/doc/influxql.md">InfluxQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ovh/erlenmeyer/blob/master/doc/graphite.md">Graphite</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On Clever Cloud, we deployed an <code>Erlenmeyer</code> in front of our Warp10 backend. This means <strong>all</strong> these <strong>open source protocols</strong> can be used to query our application Metrics. The <strong>host</strong> is <code>https://PROTO-c1-warp10-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com/PROTO</code> with <code>PROTO</code> being:</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>for PromQL: <code>prometheus</code>,</li>
<li>for OpenTSDB: <code>opentsdb</code>,</li>
<li>for InfluxQL: <code>influxql</code>,</li>
<li>for Graphite: <code>graphite</code>.</li>
</ul>
<div>To authenticate your request, you need to use the Warp10 READ TOKEN as the password of the basic authentication. You can find it in the metrics panel of any Clever Cloud application:</div>

<h2>Retrieve the memory data with PromQL</h2>
<div>As a first step, let&#8217;s store the Warp10 <code>READ TOKEN</code> and an <code>APP_ID</code> as an <strong>environment variable</strong>:</div>
</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">export TOKEN=MY_AWESOME_TOKEN # Replace the value by your Clever Cloud Warp10 token
export APP_ID=app_test # Replace the value by one of your own Clever Cloud application
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Get raw data</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>To retrieve the <code>mem.used_percent</code> in <strong>PromQL</strong>, we need to send an <code>HTTP GET</code> request to Erlenmeyer, with the TOKEN as basic AUTH. In that case, the PromQL <code>GET</code> request requires four parameters: query, start, end and step. Similarly, to learn more about the PromQL language, you can read the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">Prometheus documentation</a>. In our case we will create a simple query to get the raw data:</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">api/v1/query_range?
query=mem.used_percent{app_id="$APP_ID"}&amp;
start=1623289800&amp;
end=1623311400&amp;
step=120s</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<div>The <code>query</code> parameter is used for the PromQL queries: <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are milliseconds timestamps corresponding to the time limit to get data. And the <code>step</code> one is the <strong>sampling</strong> parameter.</div>
<div>As data are collected around every minute, let&#8217;s set at least twice the duration: <code>120s</code>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, to get the result, execute the following <code>cURL</code> <strong>url encoded</strong>:</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">curl --request GET --url "https://u:${TOKEN}@prometheus-c1-warp10-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com/prometheus/api/v1/query_range?query=mem.used_percent%7Bapp_id%3D%22${APP_ID}%22%7D&amp;start=1623289800&amp;end=1623311400&amp;step=120s" --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
</code></pre>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Group by example</h3>
<p>A group by query can be useful in the Clever Cloud case to merge some series (multiple deployments or instances). Thus we will <strong>group</strong> data based on the <code>app_id</code> labels in the following example.</p>
<div>We will re-use the stored variable <code>READ_TOKEN</code>  and <code>APP_ID</code>. To compute a group by in our case we apply the <code>max</code> PromQL <strong>function</strong> grouped by the series <code>app_id</code> label:</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">api/v1/query_range?
query=max(mem.used_percent{app_id="$APP_ID"}) by (app_id)&amp;
start=1623289800&amp;
end=1623311400&amp;
step=120s
</code></pre>
<div>
<div>Finally to get the result, execute the following <code>cURL</code> <strong>url encoded</strong>:</div>
<div></div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">curl --request GET --url "https://u:${TOKEN}@prometheus-c1-warp10-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com/prometheus/api/v1/query_range?query=max(mem.used_percent%7Bapp_id%3D%22${APP_ID}%22%7D)%20by%20(app_id)&amp;start=1623289800&amp;end=1623311400&amp;step=120s" --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Grafana PromQL data source</h2>
<p>You may use <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> to create you own dashboards, which is an open source interactive visualisation web application (to deploy a Grafana as a Clever Cloud application, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/grafana-example">github example</a> and you can also follow this <a href="https://blog.kbdev.io/dev/2021/08/24/grafana-clevercloud.html">French blog post</a>). Of course you can configure a <strong>PromQL</strong> <strong>data source</strong> to get Clever Cloud applications metrics:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>create a <strong>Prometheus</strong> source,</li>
<li>then set Prometheus source <strong>host</strong> to <code>https://prometheus-c1-warp10-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com/prometheus</code>,</li>
<li>in addition activate the<strong> basic authentication</strong> with a <strong>user</strong> set to <code>metrics</code> and a <strong>password</strong> containing your <code>read Warp10 token</code>,</li>
<li>to conclude, click on <code>Save and Test</code>, your Prometheus data source should now be working!</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Prometheus UI with remote_read endpoint</h2>
<p>Like with Grafana, you can use <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">Prometheus</a> and plot Clever Cloud metrics in the <strong>Web UI</strong>. And as a matter of fact, simply fill your Prometheus <strong>configuration</strong> with a <strong>remote_read</strong> source:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">api/v1/query_range?
remote_read:
  - url: "https://prometheus-c1-warp10-clevercloud-customers.services.clever-cloud.com/prometheus/remote_read/"
  basic_auth:
    username: "metrics"
    password: "TOKEN"
</code></pre>
<div></div>
<div>Restart Prometheus, then simply execute a Prometheus query in the UI as below:</div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">{ __name__= "mem.used_percent", app_id="$APP_ID" }
</code></pre>
<div>Our backend is able to correctly resolve <code>.</code>  which are invalid prometheus characters. Nonetheless the backend response will always translate those <code>.</code> values in series data (name or labels) into valid <code>_</code>.</div>
</div>
<h2>To Sum Up</h2>
<p>As you can see with this post, you can get metrics of Clever Cloud applications and add-ons. Presently you now have <strong>one more way</strong> to query them, as Erlenmeyer allows the use of <code>PromQL</code>. However the drawback is that you will have to <strong>update regularly your token</strong>, as they expire in a few days. We are working on a solution to improve the user experience. First, we will soon provide our customers with access to a <strong>Grafana</strong> with <strong>configured data source and already pre-filled dashboards</strong>. The <strong>token</strong> will be handled on our side and you will then be able to build your own graphs with <code>PromQL</code> or <code>WarpScript</code> queries.</p>
</div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img width="318" height="123" src="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/09/pulsar-318x123.png" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="Apache Pulsar Public Beta release" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/09/pulsar-318x123.png 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/09/pulsar-667x257.png 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/09/pulsar-768x296.png 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/09/pulsar.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></div><p>It&#8217;s a big day for queuing and streaming enthusiasts today. Our engineering team is proud to release Apache Pulsar as an add-on on Clever Cloud in public beta!</p>
<p><span id="more-3279"></span></p>
<p>Apache Pulsar is a distributed messaging and streaming platform based on a &#8220;publish-subscribe&#8221; model. Clever Cloud Pulsar add-on provides one Pulsar namespace, with almost all management rights.</p>
<h2>Common use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Replicating data among databases</b> using Pulsar IO is commonly used to distribute change events from databases.</li>
<li><b>Parallel processing and workflows.</b> You can efficiently distribute a large number of tasks among multiple workers (compressing text files, sending email notifications).</li>
<li><b>Data streaming from IoT devices.</b> For example, a residential sensor can stream data to backend servers.</li>
<li><b>Refreshing distributed caches.</b> For example, an application can publish invalidation events to update the IDs of objects that have changed.</li>
<li><b>Real-time event distribution.</b> Events, raw or processed, may be made available to multiple applications across your team and organization for real-time processing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Biscuit token support</h2>
<p>At Clever Cloud, we are working on the <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2021/04/12/introduction-to-biscuit/">Biscuit token</a>, the foundation for our authorization systems. Consequently, we open-sourced our <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/biscuit-pulsar/commits/master">Biscuit token for Pulsar implementation</a> which is directly pluggable to the Pulsar authentication and authorization system.</p>
<p>This way, we can provide a Pulsar namespace with token-based authorizations. A generated access token enables you to operate your Pulsar namespace and its topics directly using the Pulsar Admin REST API.</p>
<p>Using the power of Biscuit tokens, you can also attenuate your Biscuit token and create a new token that is only able to consume a single topic or multiple topics matching a regex. <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/pulsar/#authorization">Here</a> is an example with a topic prefix.</p>
<p>The rights management we support is documented <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/pulsar/#operations">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>We advise you to use <a href="https://github.com/streamnative/pulsarctl">pulsarctl</a> provided by StreamNative. Here is an example to list topics in your namespace:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pulsarctl \
--admin-service-url $ADDON_PULSAR_HTTP_URL \
--auth-params $ADDON_PULSAR_TOKEN \
--auth-plugin org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationToken \
namespaces topics $ADDON_PULSAR_TENANT/$ADDON_PULSAR_NAMESPACE</code></pre>
<p>As Biscuit is a token, you can use <code>AuthenticationToken("")</code> provided by clients libraries to authenticate to our clusters without any tweak.</p>
<ul>
<li>C++ client</li>
<li>C# client</li>
<li>Go client</li>
<li>Java client (<a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/pulsar/#java-example">example)</a></li>
<li>Node.js client</li>
<li>Python client</li>
<li>Rust client (<a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/pulsar/#rust-example">example</a>)</li>
<li>WebSocket client</li>
</ul>
<h2>Storage policies</h2>
<p>The Pulsar add-on comes with default retention policies and offload policies.</p>
<h3>Retention policies</h3>
<p>A freshly created Pulsar add-on has infinite retention policies, you can change it using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Example to set retention of namespace to 2 weeks and/or 100 GB
pulsarctl \
--admin-service-url $ADDON_PULSAR_HTTP_URL \
--auth-params $ADDON_PULSAR_TOKEN \
--auth-plugin org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationToken \
namespaces set-retention $ADDON_PULSAR_TENANT/$ADDON_PULSAR_NAMESPACE --time 2w --size 100G</code></pre>
<h3>Offload policies (cold storage)</h3>
<p>Each <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/pulsar/">Pulsar add-on</a> is provided with a hidden <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/cellar/">Cellar add-on</a> (object-storage add-on) used as a target for offloading data to cold storage. These policies are deactivated by default; you can enable offloading using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"># Example to set offload to run when hot storage is &gt; 10G and put data to Cellar add-on as cold storage
pulsarctl \
--admin-service-url $ADDON_PULSAR_HTTP_URL \
--auth-params $ADDON_PULSAR_TOKEN \
--auth-plugin org.apache.pulsar.client.impl.auth.AuthenticationToken \
namespaces set-offload-treshold $ADDON_PULSAR_TENANT/$ADDON_PULSAR_NAMESPACE 10G</code></pre>
<p>Considering the previous retention of 100GB and the offload threshold of 10G. You will always have 10GB in the hot storage (Apache BookKeeper) and 90GB in Cellar.</p>
<p>We will provide in the add-on dashboard the current storage usage of your hot and cold storage.</p>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>Today, the pricing is in beta, meaning that it is <strong>subject to change</strong> depending on our client&#8217;s usages.<br />
Please try the calculator to simulate the cost of your usage.</p>
<p><script type="module" src="https://components.clever-cloud.com/load.js?version=7.2&amp;lang=en&amp;components=cc-pricing-product-consumption.smart"></script></p>
<div>Storage part must be considered as hot storage.</p>
<p>Considered as cold storage.</p>

Do you dream of balancing the load of your requests across a PostgreSQL cluster? Either way, we&#8217;ve got the solution for you.</p>
<p>Clever Cloud is proud to introduce the native support of Pgpool-II on all application instances, for no additional fee.</p>
<p><span id="more-3001"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/postgresql/pgpool">See the Clever Cloud documentation on Pgpool-II</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-pgpool-ii">What is Pgpool-II?</h2>
<p>It is a middleware that comes in between your application and your PostgreSQL database (<a href="https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page">official website</a>). As its name suggests, it <em>pools</em> your app&#8217;s connections to PostgreSQL, by saving and reusing them, and letting them wait when they are too many.</p>
<p>Pgpool-II also serves as a load balancer for PostgreSQL replicas for superior scaling. More on this below.</p>
<p>Pgpool-II now works out of the box on all Clever Cloud machines. Only exception: if you use docker, you&#8217;ll have to configure the Dockerfile yourself.</p>
<h2 id="no-more-connection-refused">No more <code>connection refused</code></h2>
<p>Pgpool-II overall smoothens the use of PostgreSQL.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessed on a Unix socket</strong>: faster than a TCP socket. Gotta chase those nanoseconds.</li>
<li><strong>Connection reuse</strong>: Pgpool saves connections and reuses them when similar ones come in (same user, same database…).</li>
<li><strong>Managing exceeding connections</strong>: Normally, PostgreSQL takes only so many concurrent connections, and discards any additional ones, which compromises the app. Pgpool-II, instead, queues the excess connections for later. No more <code>connection refused</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-i-have-to-do">What do I have to do?</h2>
<p>Barely anything. By changing only one environment variable in your code, your app will send its requests to Pgpool-II directly.</p>
<p>In a typical PHP app, you would connect to a PostgreSQL add-on by doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-PHP">$host = getenv("POSTGRESQL_ADDON_HOST");
</code></pre>
<p>You just need to change that into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-PHP">$host = getenv("CC_PGPOOL_SOCKET_PATH");
</code></pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to change in your code. User, password, all other calls to environment variables remain the same. See <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/postgresql/pgpool/#usage">the doc</a> for details.</p>
<p>Now in the Clever Cloud Console, go to your app&#8217;s environment variables, set <code>CC_ENABLE_PGPOOL</code> to <code>true</code>, and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>
<h2 id="load-balancing-lets-go-big">Load balancing: let&#8217;s go big</h2>
<p>Suppose your web app is BIG. You&#8217;ve got a few <code>INSERT</code> queries to make (registering a new customer for instance), and a ton of <code>SELECT</code> queries (searches, filling pages with products, you name it). It becomes wise to create <em>replicas</em> of your database, a PostgreSQL feature. These identical instances, called <em>followers</em>, are exact copycats of your <em>leader</em> database. On the graph they are called <em>primary</em> and <em>standby</em>, respectively. There can be several <em>standby</em> nodes.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img style="width: 600px;" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/pgpool.png" /></center></p>
<p>Pgpool-II will direct the <strong>write queries</strong> to the <em>primary</em>, and dispatch the <strong>read queries</strong> to the <em>standby</em> nodes, thus balancing the load and increasing throughput.</p>
<p>More details <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/postgresql/pgpool/#how-to-configure-pgpool-ii">in the doc</a>. All you have to do is create as many PostgreSQL add-ons as you want replicas, and ask us to do the plumbing for you.</p>

<p><span id="more-2779"></span></p>
<p>The first time I wrote about Redis was six years ago, when we introduced Redis on Clever Cloud. Over the years, we’ve improved Redis with a great GUI (Redsmin), the ability to configure a follower. And now, we’re introducing brand new prices.</p>
<h2 id="the-prices">The Prices</h2>
<p>At Clever Cloud, our goal is to help people to be more agile by providing efficient and fully managed services, with a fair price.</p>
<p>Since 2016, our Redis offers needed a pricing and features revamp to stay competitive. So today we are happy to offer a more consistent and linear offer: our previous plans used to start at €8.67 per month for 100 MB. We are now at €4.84 for the same amount of memory.</p>
<div>
  <script type="module" src="https://components.clever-cloud.com/load.js?version=6&#038;components=cc-pricing-product.smart-addon"></script><br />
  <cc-smart-container context='{"productId":"redis-addon","addonFeatures":["cpu","max-db-size","connection-limit"]}'><br />
    <cc-pricing-product mode="addon" action="none" style="margin: 2em 0;box-shadow: 0 0 0.5em #ddd;border-radius: 0.5em;overflow: hidden; color: #1e254e"></p>
<div slot="head"></div>
<p>    </cc-pricing-product><br />
  </cc-smart-container>
</div>
<h2 id="the-changes">The Changes</h2>
<p>Now databases are not limited to 100 by default: the new plans ramp up from 1 to 20 databases maximum, which should be sufficient for most use cases. These changes are part of a greater overhaul on our Redis offers, stay tuned!</p>

<p><span id="more-2987"></span></p>
<p>ProxySQL acts as a local proxy between your application and your MySQL add-on. Your application will be able to connect to ProxySQL which will then forward your requests to the linked MySQL add-on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A connection pool will cache your database connections and keep them open for future requests</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the connection pool, your database connections will be cached and your application won&#39;t have to wait for the connection to be established to your add-on. This can lead to faster response time when a lot of requests are executed. It also solves the problem of too many opened connections to the database. You will be able to do as many queries as you need without getting a &quot;user max connection exceeded&quot; error. ProxySQL will queue all the requests until a connection slot is available.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote: ProxySQL is not available on Docker instances as we do not manage your Dockerfile.</em></p>
<h2 id="configure-proxysql">Configure ProxySQL</h2>
<p>To enable ProxySQL for your application, you first need to have a MySQL add-on linked to your application. You then have to set the <code>CC_ENABLE_MYSQL_PROXYSQL=true</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>Once enabled, the <code>CC_MYSQL_PROXYSQL_SOCKET_PATH</code> environment variable will be injected during the deployment phase. It provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix Domain Socket</a> path to use to connect to ProxySQL.</p>
<p>There are also two other environment variables you can set to configure ProxySQL to match your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CC_MYSQL_PROXYSQL_USE_TLS</code>: A boolean (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) to enable <code>TLS</code> between ProxySQL and your MySQL add-on. Defaults to <code>true</code>.</li>
<li><code>CC_MYSQL_PROXYSQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS</code>: An integer which defines how many maximum connections ProxySQL will open to your MySQL add-on. Defaults to <code>10</code>. You can refer to <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/mysql/proxysql#scalability">our ProxySQL documentation</a> to learn more about how you should compute the maximum connection value when auto scalability is involved.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some examples on how to connect to ProxySQL using various languages:</p>
<h4 id="php-using-pdo">PHP using PDO</h4>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.connection.php">PDO</a>, you have to use the <code>unix_socket</code> option in your DSN:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
// This variable is injected during the deployment
$socket = getenv(&quot;CC_MYSQL_PROXYSQL_SOCKET_PATH&quot;);
// Get the database name from the environment
$db = getenv(&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_DB&quot;);
// Get the database user from the environment
$user = getenv(&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_USER&quot;);
// Get the database password from the environment
$pass = getenv(&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_PASSWORD&quot;);
$dsn = &quot;mysql:unix_socket=$socket;dbname=$db&quot;;
try {
  $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
  throw new PDOException($e-&gt;getMessage(), (int)$e-&gt;getCode());
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="wordpress">WordPress</h4>
<p>For WordPress, you can change the <code>DB_HOST</code> variable in your <code>wp-config.php</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">// To connect using a unix socket, the syntax is: `localhost:/path/to/socket`
define(&#39;DB_HOST&#39;, &quot;localhost:&quot; . getenv(&quot;CC_MYSQL_PROXYSQL_SOCKET_PATH&quot;) );
// Get the database user from the environment
define(&#39;DB_USER&#39;, getenv(&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_USER&quot;));
// Get the database password from the environment
define(&#39;DB_PASSWORD&#39;, getenv(&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_PASSWORD&quot;));
// Get the database name from the environment
define(&#39;DB_NAME&#39;, getenv(&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_DB&quot;));
</code></pre>
<h4 id="nodejs">Node.js</h4>
<p>On Node.js, using the <code>mysql</code> npm package, you have to set the <code>socketPath</code> property :</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const mysql      = require(&#39;mysql&#39;);
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  // Get ProxySQL unix domain socket path from the environment
  socketPath : process.env[&quot;CC_MYSQL_PROXYSQL_SOCKET_PATH&quot;],
  // Get the database user from the environment
  user       : process.env[&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_USER&quot;],
  // Get the database password from the environment
  password   : process.env[&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_PASSWORD&quot;],
  // Get the database name from the environment
  database   : process.env[&quot;MYSQL_ADDON_DB&quot;]
});
connection.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(&#39;error connecting: &#39; + err.stack);
    return;
  }

  console.log(&#39;connected as id &#39; + connection.threadId);
});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>
<p>ProxySQL exposes some metrics using the Prometheus format. Those metrics are automatically collected into our Metrics system and can be accessed in the <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/administrate/metrics/overview/#display-metrics">Advanced Metrics</a> view of your application. This allows you to track how effective your connection pool is and how many request your instances are making. You can get the list of metrics we expose in <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/mysql/proxysql#metrics">our ProxySQL documentation</a></p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>You can find more information about this feature in <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/mysql/proxysql">our ProxySQL documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Using ProxySQL may help decrease the response time of your application if it does a lot of SQL requests. We&#39;d love to hear from you on how ProxySQL&#39;s connection pool affected your applications performances.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image"><img width="318" height="123" src="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/08/superset-318x123.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="" loading="lazy" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" srcset="https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/08/superset-318x123.jpg 318w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/08/superset-667x257.jpg 667w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/08/superset-768x296.jpg 768w, https://staging-cc-assets.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/uploads/2021/08/superset.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px" /></div><p>At Clever Cloud we manage most of our own data and when we want to gather a particular information, we open our SQL interpreter and query all the things manually. This somehow worked because most of us are technical but it&#39;s not necessary the case anymore. So we want a nice dashboarding solution to make data available in a nicer way. This is how we came to try Superset.</p>
<p><span id="more-2834"></span></p>
<p>What is Superset? In their own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Superset is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can configure different sort of visualizations from simple line charts to highly detailed geo-spatial charts and organize them in dashboard. Take a look at  <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">their documentation</a> to grasp the full extent of what you can do.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-deploy-superset">How to deploy Superset</h2>
<p>Superset is written in Python and requires a PostgreSQL database. In Clever Cloud terms it means you will need to create a brand <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/application/python/python_apps/">new Python runtime</a> with a <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/deploy/addon/postgresql/">PostgreSQL addon</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Clone last superset release
git clone --depth 1 -b 0.38.1  https://github.com/apache/superset.git

# Move in superset repository
cd superset

# Create the python application
clever create --type python Superset

# Create the PostgreSQL instance
clever addon create postgresql-addon --plan m SupersetPG

# link the addon
clever service link-addon SupersetPG
</code></pre>
<p>Once the application is created, edit it&#39;s information. As you need to build Superset backend and frontend, you need to enable a <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/administrate/apps-management/#edit-application-configuration">dedicated build instance</a>, select the <code>L</code> one. Don&#39;t foget to save the update.</p>
<h3 id="superset-environment">Superset environment</h3>
<p>Set the following environment, <code>YOUR_APP_ID</code> corresponds to your own application id, <code>A_SECRET_KEY</code> is a random secret key you choose, and <code>AN_ADMIN_PASSWORD</code> will be the admin password for the superset application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Use gunicorn as python mode
clever env set CC_PYTHON_BACKEND gunicorn

# Start the app using create_app()
clever env set CC_PYTHON_MODULE superset.app:create_app()

# Python version to use
clever env set CC_PYTHON_VERSION 3.7

# Load all superset requirements
clever env set CC_PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE requirements/base.txt

# Application port
clever env set PORT 8080

# PYTHONPATH
clever env set PYTHONPATH /home/bas/YOUR_APP_ID/config/

# App secret key
clever env set SECRET_KEY A_SECRET_KEY

# Post build commands
clever env set CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK ./init.sh

# Superset admin password
clever env set ADMIN_PASSWORD AN_ADMIN_PASSWORD
</code></pre>
<h3 id="configure-superset">Configure superset</h3>
<p>Superset need a local config python file. Wrote locally a <code>clever_config.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os
# Superset specific config
ROW_LIMIT = 5000

SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_PORT = os.getenv(&quot;PORT&quot;)
SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_ADDRESS = &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;

# Flask App Builder configuration
# Your App secret key
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv(&quot;SECRET_KEY&quot;)

# The SQLAlchemy connection string to your database backend
# This connection defines the path to the database that stores your
# superset metadata (slices, connections, tables, dashboards, ...).
# Note that the connection information to connect to the datasources
# you want to explore are managed directly in the web UI
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.getenv(&quot;POSTGRESQL_ADDON_URI&quot;)

# Flask-WTF flag for CSRF
WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = True
# Add endpoints that need to be exempt from CSRF protection
WTF_CSRF_EXEMPT_LIST = []
# A CSRF token that expires in 1 year
WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365

# Set this API key to enable Mapbox visualizations
MAPBOX_API_KEY = &#39;&#39;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="superset-build-scipt">Superset build scipt</h3>
<p>The next step is to write an <code>init.sh</code>file that will include all build tasks for superset:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

# Load configuration file in PYTHONPATH
mkdir $APP_HOME/config
cp clever_config.py $APP_HOME/config/superset_config.py

# Create an admin user (you will be prompted to set username, first and last name before setting a password)
superset fab create-admin \
    --username admin \
    --firstname admin \
    --lastname admin \
    --email admin@admin.com \
    --password ${ADMIN_PASSWORD}

# Upgrade the database
superset db upgrade

# Loading examples data set (optional)
superset load_examples

# Create default roles and permissions
superset init

# Build frontend
cd superset-frontend
npm install -f --no-optional
npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>Clever supports <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/develop/build-hooks/#post-build-cc_post_build_hook">post build hooks</a>, this <code>init.sh</code> file will be played at the end of the build phase.</p>
<p>It&#39;s used to set the config file we wrote before into <code>PYTHONPATH</code> used by the application. Then it will start some superset commands required for the first start of the application (create the admin user if it doesn&#39;t exists, upgrade  the database, and file it with examples and finally init the superset appication). Those superset commands could be remove of the init file after the first success build. Finally, this script is used to also build the frontend of the superset application.</p>
<h3 id="superset-requirements">Superset requirements</h3>
<p>When you added the <code>CC_PIP_REQUIREMENTS_FILE</code>, it told clever cloud to load custom requirement for superset which are locate in the <code>requirements/base.txt</code> file. As you are using the PostgreSQL add-on, you need to add its requirement in this base file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;psycopg2&gt;=2.7 --no-binary psycopg2&quot; &gt;&gt; requirements/base.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The Clever Cloud python application still needs a local <code>requirements.txt</code> to start the install. Generate it with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>As we use gunicorn and the PostgreSQL add-on, they are required in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, add them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo &quot;psycopg2&gt;=2.7 --no-binary psycopg2&quot; &gt;&gt; requirements.txt

# gunicorn valid versions are located in setup.py file
echo &quot;gunicorn&gt;=20.0.2, &lt;20.1&quot; &gt;&gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h3 id="deploy">Deploy</h3>
<p>Deploy the superset application into Clever cloud:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod u+x init.sh

# Add your files
git add .

# Create the first commit
git commit -m &quot;clever init&quot;

# Deploy the application
clever deploy

# Run the application
clever open
</code></pre>
<p>Once this is done you should be able to access the superset application, enjoy!</p>
<p>After the first successful <code>superset</code> deployement you can remove on the <code>init.sh</code> file all commands starting with superset (they are required for the first start).</p>

Let&#39;s see how it works!</p>
<p><span id="more-2833"></span></p>
<h2 id="from-a-personal-blog-to-an-entire-newspaper">From a personal blog to an entire newspaper</h2>
<p>As an example, we will build up authorization policies, going from a small, personal blog, to a professional journal with multiple teams, editors, etc.</p>
<p>Since those policies will be written in Datalog, let&#39;s take a short look at that language first.</p>
<h3 id="side-note-introduction-to-datalog">Side note: introduction to Datalog</h3>
<p>Datalog is a declarative logic language that is a subset of Prolog. A Datalog program contains &quot;facts&quot;, which represent data, and &quot;rules&quot;, which can generate new facts from existing ones.</p>
<p>As an example, we could define the following facts, describing some relationships:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">parent(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;);
parent(&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;);
parent(&quot;Charles&quot;, &quot;Denise&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This means that Alice is Bob&#39;s parent, and so on.</p>
<p>This could be seen as a table in a relational database:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>parent</th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Alice</td>
<td>Bob</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>Charles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Charles</td>
<td>Denise</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can then define rules to query our data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">parent_of_charles($name) &lt;-
  parent($name, &quot;Charles&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This could be written in SQL as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT DISTINCT name from parent where child = &quot;Charles&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>(we use <code>DISTINCT</code> because Datalog will always remove redundant results)</p>
<p>We can also use rules to create new facts, like this one: (variables are introduced with the <code>$</code> sign)</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">grandparent($grandparent, $child) &lt;-
  parent($grandparent, $parent),
  parent($parent, $child);
</code></pre>
<p>You can read it as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">create the fact grandparent($grandparent, $child)
  IF
    there is a fact parent($grandparent, $parent)
    AND there is a fact parent($parent, $child)
    with matching $parent variable
</code></pre>
<p>or in SQL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">INSERT INTO grandparent( name, grandchild )
  SELECT A.name as name, B.child as grandchild
  FROM parent A, parent B
  WHERE A.child = B.name;
</code></pre>
<p>Applying this rule will look at combinations of the <code>parent</code> facts as defined on the right side of the arrow (the &quot;body&quot; of the rule), and try to match them to the variables (<code>$grandparent</code>, <code>$parent</code>, <code>$child</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parent(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;), parent(&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;)</code> matches because we can<br />
replace <code>$grandparent</code> with <code>&quot;Alice&quot;</code>, <code>$parent</code> with <code>&quot;Bob&quot;</code>, <code>$child</code> with <code>&quot;Charles&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>parent(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;), parent(&quot;Charles&quot;, &quot;Denise&quot;)</code> does not match because<br />
we would get different values for the <code>$parent</code> variable</li>
</ul>
<p>For each matching combination of facts in the body, we will then generate a fact, as defined on the left side of the arrow, the <em>head</em> of the rule. For <code>parent(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;), parent(&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;)</code>, we would generate <code>grandparent(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;)</code>. A fact can be generated from multiple rules, but we will get only one instance of it.</p>
<p>Going through all the combinations, we will generate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">grandparent(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;);
grandparent(&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Denise&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>which can be seen as:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>grandparent</th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Alice</td>
<td>Charles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>Denise</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Interactions with a Datalog program are done through queries: <strong>a query contains a rule</strong> that we apply over the system, and <strong>it returns the generated facts</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="first-steps-personal-blog">First steps: personal blog</h3>
<p>*note: you can follow along the various steps of this tutorial in the <a href="https://play-with-biscuit.cleverapps.io/blog.html">online playground</a>.</p>
<p>When we are the only user of that blog, we do not need much (honestly we could get away with just a random string in a cookie, but bear with me). We only need a way to identify ourselves to the blog engine&#39;s admin panel. So we could just consider the Biscuit token as a fancy JWT, that will only contain data (so, in Datalog, facts).</p>
<p>Our token will contain this fact: <code>user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;)</code>.</p>
<p>Here, <code>&quot;user_1234&quot;</code> is our user id, and <code>#authority</code> is a special symbol that can only be added to facts in the first block of a token (or added by the verifier). A block contains facts (data), rules (to generate facts) and checks (queries used to validate the facts). Attenuation is done by adding more blocks. Since <code>#authority</code> facts are about the basic rights of a token, adding <code>#authority</code> facts would increase the number of rights. So we forbid adding <code>#authority</code> facts in additional blocks. Symbols, as indicated by the <code>#</code> prefix, are special strings that are internally replaced with integers, to compress tokens and accelerate evaluation.</p>
<p>The token can be serialized to a byte array (encoded with Protobuf) and then to base64 if we want to carry it in a cookie.</p>
<p>On the blog engine&#39;s side, we will only have this single line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">allow if user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Biscuit can enforce authorization in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>checks, starting with <code>check if</code></li>
<li>allow/deny policies, starting with <code>allow if</code> or <code>deny if</code></li>
</ul>
<p>They work a bit like rules: if there&#39;s at least one combination of fact in the body (after the <code>if</code>) that fits, then it matches. They will not produce any fact.</p>
<p>To validate a token:</p>
<ul>
<li>all of the checks must match. If one does not, fail</li>
<li>allow/deny policies are tried in order until one matches
<ul>
<li>if allow matches, succeed</li>
<li>if deny matches, fail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if none match, fail</li>
</ul>
<p>Here the allow test will succeed if the token contains the fact <code>user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;)</code></p>
<p>It is not very useful yet, but maybe we can add more features?</p>
<h3 id="next-multi-blog-platform">Next: multi-blog platform</h3>
<p>After a few friends have seen your marvelous website, they ask if you could host their blogs on the same platform. So now you need more flexible authorization rules. We could keep the small tokens with the user id, but add more intelligence on the server&#39;s side.</p>
<p>First we need to indicate who owns which blog, with the format <code>owner(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id)</code>. You can load this data when creating the verifier, from your database, from static files, etc.</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog1&quot;);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_5678&quot;, &quot;blog2&quot;);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog3&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Here we own <code>&quot;blog1&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;blog3&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;user_5678&quot;</code> owns <code>&quot;blog2&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Now we need to actually validate the request, to see who has access to what. The request is represented through the <code>#ambient</code> facts, added to the verifier: you indicate to the verifier facts representing the current request like which resource is accessed, which operation (read, write, etc), the current time, the source IP address, etc. As an example, a <code>PUT /blog1/article1</code> to modify an article could be translated as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">blog(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;);
article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;);
operation(#ambient, #update);
</code></pre>
<p>In the verifier, we add a rule to indicate that the owner of a blog has full rights on it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, $operation) &lt;-
    article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
    operation(#ambient, $operation),
    user(#authority, $user_id),
    owner(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id);
</code></pre>
<p>If this rules finds a matching set of facts, it will produce a <code>right(...)</code> fact.</p>
<p>The verifier will also use an allow policy for the presence of that <code>right</code> (you will see why we separate them in the next section):</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">allow if
  blog(#ambient, $blog_id),
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  operation(#ambient, $operation),
  right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, $operation);

// unauthenticated users have read access
allow if
  operation(#ambient, #read);

// catch all rule in case the allow did not match
deny if true;
</code></pre>
<p>So if we tried to do a <code>PUT /blog1/article1</code> with the token containing <code>user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;)</code>, we would end up with the following facts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;);
blog(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;);
article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;);
operation(#ambient, #update);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog1&quot;);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_5678&quot;, &quot;blog2&quot;);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog3&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>If we applied the verifier&#39;s rule, we would end up with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">right(#authority, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;, #update) &lt;-
    owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog1&quot;),
    article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;),
    user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;),
    operation(#ambient, #update);
</code></pre>
<p>So we end up with the new fact <code>right(#authority, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;, #update)</code>.</p>
<p>Now the verifier applies the check:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">allow if
  blog(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;),
  article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;),
  operation(#ambient, #update),
  right(#authority, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;, #update);
</code></pre>
<p>And the test succeeds! If we had tried the request with a token containing <code>user(#authority, &quot;user_5678&quot;)</code>, the rule would not have produced the <code>right()</code> fact, and it would have failed.</p>
<p>Now if we did a <code>GET /blog1/article1</code> request, without being the owner of the blog, we would have matched <code>allow if operation(#ambient, #read)</code>.</p>
<p>But maybe we don&#39;t want to have all articles available by default, maybe some of them are still in writing, so let&#39;s remove that allow policy. We want to mark an article as publicly readable by creating the fact <code>readable(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id)</code>. We can do that with this test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">allow if
  operation(#ambient, #read),
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  readable(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id);
</code></pre>
<p>So if we did a <code>GET /blog1/article1</code> request with that article marked as readable, we would get the facts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">blog(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;);
article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;);
operation(#ambient, #read);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog1&quot;);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_5678&quot;, &quot;blog2&quot;);
owner(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;, &quot;blog3&quot;);
readable(#authority, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The test would apply as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">allow if
  operation(#ambient, #read),
  article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;),
  readable(#authority, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>And we got access. In a few lines, we created basic rules to protect our blog platform. But users need more features!</p>
<h3 id="add-reviewers">add reviewers</h3>
<p>Often, we&#39;d like to ask friends and colleagues to review articles before they are published. In our system, it could be done in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>mint a token containing only <code>right(#authority, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;, #read)</code></li>
<li>derive the user&#39;s token, adding a check restricting to the article</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second case, the token would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Block 0 (authority):
  facts: [ user(#authority, &quot;user_1234&quot;) ]
  rules: []
  checks: []

Block 1:
  facts: []
  rules: []
  check: [
    check if article(#ambient, &quot;blog1&quot;, &quot;article1&quot;), operation(#ambient, #read)
  ]
</code></pre>
<p>if we tried to do a <code>PUT /blog1/article1</code>, the verifier&#39;s checks would succeed, but the token&#39;s check would fail, because it does not find the <code>operation(#ambient, #read)</code> fact. But for a <code>GET /blog1/article1</code>, all checks would succeed. The reviewer will not be able to remove the block while keeping a valid signature, so any alteration will result in a failed request.</p>
<h3 id="premium-accounts">premium accounts</h3>
<p>Now some of the blog authors want to make living out of it (come on, it&#39;s 2021, do a newsletter instead) and mark some articles as &quot;premium&quot;, so that only some users can access them.</p>
<p>We can do that by having <code>premium_user(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id)</code> facts and adding a rule on the verifier&#39;s side:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, #read) &lt;-
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  premium_readable(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id),
  user(#authority, $user_id),
  premium_user(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id);
</code></pre>
<p>We could even add a feature like <a href="https://lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> where a paying user can share a premium article, by deriving their tokens to only accept that article.</p>
<h3 id="were-a-big-newspaper-now-we-want-roles-and-teams">We&#39;re a big newspaper now, we want roles and teams</h3>
<p>Againt all odds, our blog platform is a smashing success. We need to recruit journalists, editors, copywriters&#8230; So now we might need more flexible rights management, maybe some teams and roles?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s define more facts and rules to encode that. As an example, let&#39;s define a &quot;contributor&quot; role that can only read or write articles, while owners are the only ones who can create or delete.</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, $operation) &lt;-
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  operation(#ambient, $operation),
  user(#authority, $user_id),
  contributor(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id),
  [#read, #update].contains($operation);
</code></pre>
<p>What you can see on the last line is an <em>expression</em>: Biscuit&#39;s Datalog implementation can require additional conditions on some values, like a string matching a regular expression, or a date being lower than an expiration date, or here, presence in a set. This rule will only produce if the operation is <code>#read</code> or <code>#update</code>.</p>
<p>Now, we want to define contributor teams to manage them more easily. So we will introduce the <code>team(#authority, $team_id)</code>, <code>member(#authority, $user_id, $team_id)</code> and <code>team_role(#authority, $team_id, $blog_id, #contributor)</code> facts.</p>
<p>Additionally, we insert this rule in the verifier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">contributor(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id) &lt;-
  user(#authority, $user_id),
  member(#authority, $user_id, $team_id),
  team_role(#authority, $team_id, $blog_id, #contributor);
</code></pre>
<p>This rule will generate the <code>contributor</code> fact for a blog if we are member of a team that has the &quot;contributor&quot; team role.</p>
<p>We could also fold the two precedent rules in one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, $operation) &lt;-
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  operation(#ambient, $operation),
  user(#authority, $user_id),
  member(#authority, $user_id, $team_id),
  team_role(#authority, $team_id, $blog_id, #contributor),
  [#read, #write].contains($operation);
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s it! With a few rules, we can model more and more complex authorization patterns, some of them relying on user provided policies, without compromising the previous features. Rules are additive, so there&#39;s no need for a long chain of if/else and special cases hardcoded in some endpoints. Everything can be managed in one place.</p>
<p>To sum up the rules of our system:</p>
<pre><code class="language-prolog">// the owner has all rights
right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, $operation) &lt;-
    article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
    operation(#ambient, $operation),
    user(#authority, $user_id),
    owner(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id);

// premium users can access some restricted articles
right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, #read) &lt;-
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  premium_readable(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id),
  user(#authority, $user_id),
  premium_user(#authority, $user_id, $blog_id);

// define teams and roles
right(#authority, $blog_id, $article_id, $operation) &lt;-
  article(#ambient, $blog_id, $article_id),
  operation(#ambient, $operation),
  user(#authority, $user_id),
  member(#authority, $user_id, $team_id),
  team_role(#authority, $team_id, $blog_id, #contributor),
  [#read, #write].contains($operation);

// unauthenticated users have read access on published articles
allow if

<p><span id="more-2832"></span></p>
<p>Where does it fit in the current authentication projects landscape (and why all of those cake themed names)?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies are a storage area in browsers, which can contain a session identifier<br />
(the session data is then in a database, indexed by those identifiers), or<br />
authentication tokens. They&#39;re good with lots of chocolate chips.</li>
<li><a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a> or JWT<br />
(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-1">pronounced &quot;jot&quot;</a>) contain<br />
cryptographically signed data. Since the signature guarantees it has not been<br />
modified, a web application could store session data in a JWT and send it in<br />
a cookie, and read it from HTTP requests. The signature can be done with<br />
secret key cryptography (HMAC algorithm), or public key cryptography (RSA,<br />
ECDSA). They can even be encrypted, and stored in a cookie, but they cannot be<br />
eaten.</li>
<li><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub41892/">Macaroons</a> are cryptographically<br />
signed (HMAC) tokens focused on authorization. They embed <em>caveats</em>, conditions<br />
that the request must fit. They support attenuation: the holder of a token can<br />
create a new valid token by adding a caveat, further restricting the token. A<br />
macaroon can be stored in a cookie. It is also an Italian almond or coconut-based cake (do not confuse it with the French <em>macaron</em> which is also an almond<br />
based cake)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent</a> is a server-side logic<br />
language used to encode authorization policies</li>
</ul>
<p>Biscuit unifies these various approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>it can be signed with public key or secret key cryptography like JWT</li>
<li>it can be attenuated like Macaroons</li>
<li>it comes with a powerful logic language to write authorization policies, like OPA, but those policies can also be carried by the token</li>
</ul>
<p>By assembling those techniques, it opens up an array of authorization patterns that were not possible before.</p>
<p><img src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/token_disambiguation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When we started working on Biscuit, we were battling common issues in modern web applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a microservices system, how do you handle authorization from an initial<br />
request, as it goes from service to service?</li>
<li>How do you reconcile an application&#39;s authorization policies (often some basic<br />
roles and groups) with a client&#39;s organization chart?</li>
</ul>
<p>The microservices case is tricky: the initial request may come from a user for which we can look up a list of rights, but some services in the request tree may not even have a concept of user: at Clever Cloud, the service that launches virtual machines never hears about who requested a new deployment. With JWT, you could generate a temporary token in the user-facing API, and carry that from service to service. But then, any service holding that token has the entire set of rights for that request. Also, we need to make sure the authorization policies are evaluated in the same way in all services. With Macaroons, a service can attenuate the token before sending it to the next service, by adding a <em>caveat</em>, a condition over the current request (expiration date, limiting to read operations, restricting file paths to a prefix&#8230;). Unfortunately, Macaroon validation requires knowing the secret key used to generate the initial token.</p>
<p>Macaroons use a design based on chaining HMAC calculations: start from the initial secret, sign the first caveat, then for each new caveat, sign it using the previous signature as key. If you know the initial secret key, you can reconstruct the entire chain and verify that you obtain the same initial signature. But distributing that key in every service is a security risk: if someone gets access to this key, they can create a token with any authorization level they want. On the other side, JWT only requires verifiers to know a public key, and the private key can be kept in the service creating the token.</p>
<p>That was one of the motivating goals for Biscuit: <strong>what if we could attenuate the token, but still be able to verify it with public key cryptography?</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, a cryptographic concept called <em>aggregated signatures</em> can help us: we take multiple messages, each individually signed with a different public key, and we aggregate all of those signatures into one main signature. From that aggregated signature, it is impossible to remove one of the messages and keep a valid signature, but we can always add more signed messages. We can verify the aggregated signatures if we know the public keys for each message. From this, we reproduce the Macaroon design, with public key cryptography.</p>
<p>To provide attenuation, we could have reused the Macaroons approach with caveats, but its user experience was challenging: a caveat is basically a byte array for which you must design your own system to encode and test conditions.</p>
<p>For Biscuit, we chose a more general approach. We provide a logic language based on Datalog to write authorization policies. It can store data, like JWT, or small conditions like Macaroons, but it is also able to represent more complex rules like role-based access control, delegation, hierarchies. Those authorization policies can be carried by the token or provided on the verification side. They are encoded in a small binary format for transport. Additionally, it is fast to evaluate: generally, the entire process of checking the signature, deserializing the token and testing the authorization policies is done under 1 ms.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Example Datalog rule" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/biscuit-datalog-example.png"/><figcaption>Example Datalog rule</figcaption></figure>
<p>With this language (that can be learned in minutes), you get a unified way of representing complex business rules, in a testable and portable format. You can explore how policies work in a simulate environment, even write unit tests for them, then deploy them as dry-run tests and see how they would react on real world requests. Instead of a binary allow/deny result, you can gain fine-grained info, and query structured data. As an example, a request to list files would be accepted if we have the rights for it, and we can also get the filtered list of files we can access, even taking into account the attenuation rules carried by the token.</p>
<p>Multiple rule systems can be combined, which is useful for the second problem, about the mismatch between an application&#39;s policies and its user&#39;s needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>an application using GitHub or Twitter OAuth and requesting too many rights<br />
because to get a subset of rights like read access to a repository, you get<br />
it for all repositories</li>
<li>a SaaS application or hosting company for which all users from one client<br />
share one account</li>
<li>or roles and groups that do not match work segmentation for users</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditionally, this is solved in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>the service includes more and more complicated authorization policies and the<br />
user management panel becomes a complicated mess</li>
<li>it connects itself to external authorization systems, like Active Directory<br />
or Keycloak, and let the user manage them</li>
</ul>
<p>With Biscuit, there&#39;s another way. Authorization policies can be provided by the verification service, but they can also be carried by the token. The service can specify its policies, and the user can attenuate tokens with their own policies. And they will all be evaluated in the same way, while guaranteeing that the token cannot get more rights with user policies. So from an initial token, an entire parallel authorization design can be developed that will still be compatible with the original one.</p>
<p>You can also take an existing token, and restrict its access to a minimal set of resources, like you would need for your CI/CD systems. There&#39;s a lot of new patterns that will become possible with Biscuit, and we&#39;ll have to explore it more in the future. Right now, let&#39;s look at an existing use case.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>At Clever Cloud, we are heavy users of <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/">Apache Pulsar</a>. To provide this service to our users, we needed a flexible way to make it multitenant. By integrating Biscuit as an authorization plugin, using the Java implementation of Biscuit, we can provide a separate namespace for each user, but that token has full rights on that namespace. From there, the token can be attenuated to new tokens with various policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>limiting access to a topic name prefix</li>
<li>allowing subscription on only one topic</li>
<li>allowing message production on only one topic</li>
<li>adding an expiration time</li>
</ul>
<p>The authorization plugin only needs to check the token&#39;s initial rights to the namespace, and verify that the request matches the various checks added in attenuation.</p>
<p>As an example, we use that internally for a remote administration agent. Each new instance of the agent gets a new token derived from the original one, restricted to listening on its own topic (the topic name is a UUID). Then, when it receives a message, it also gets a short-lived token that can be used to send answers to a single temporary topic.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next</h2>
<p>The next article will dive into how to write policies and how to integrate it into your application. You can already test that language in the <a href="https://play-with-biscuit.cleverapps.io/">online playground</a>.</p>
<p>You can start using Biscuit right now in <a href="https://github.com/clevercloud/biscuit-rust">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clevercloud/biscuit-java">Java</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flynn/biscuit-go">Go</a>.</p>
<p>The Rust version can also generate C bindings, currently used to develop a <a href="https://github.com/divarvel/biscuit-haskell">Haskell version</a>, and there is a <a href="https://github.com/clevercloud/biscuit-wasm">WebAssembly wrapper</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/clevercloud/biscuit">specification</a> is developed in the open, you can contribute.</p>
<p>We are just at the beginning of this exciting new technology, so we are still learning how to use it, exploring new design and authorization patterns. I can&#39;t wait to see the fun applications you will come up with Biscuit!</p>

<p><span id="more-2778"></span></p>
<p>This also has some nice effects I will explain later.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We are changing the way we measure consumption, prices remain the same.</li>
<li>Uptime was billed by 10 minutes slices, it&#39;s now billed by one second slices.</li>
<li>You will be able to use credits for everything: Applications, Add-ons, custom tasks you ask to the support team.</li>
<li>Invoices will display every detail about your consumption.</li>
<li>Changing measurement should not have any major impact on your invoices.</li>
</ul>
<p>All those changes are possible because we have put a lot of work on our invoicing infrastructure. We are still working on it and will introduce even more new features in the coming months. In the meantime let’s go over those first changes.</p>
<h2 id="second-based-prices">Second based prices</h2>
<p>We have always invoiced any started 10 minutes slice. It means if you have a build that takes 12 minutes and 42 seconds to complete, you will currently be invoiced for 20 minutes. Starting April 1st you will be invoiced for the duration of the build, so 12 minutes and 42 seconds. This should result in smaller invoices, especially if you run a lot of dedicated builds.</p>
<h2 id="consume-everything-with-credits">Consume everything with Credits</h2>
<p>This is probably the nicest side of effects of all, and you have asked this for years (and I have asked it for years), you can now use your credits for <em>everything</em>. Applications, add-ons or any micro interventions or custom deployments you could ask our support team to do.</p>
<p>This will give more fluidity to our API and CLI usage when creating add-ons.</p>
<h2 id="an-invoice-with-every-details">An invoice with every details</h2>
<p>Our current invoice only has one line summing up everything consumed over the past month. The new invoice will contain a line for everything that has been consumed, whether it is an application, an add-on or a custom task. Here’s what it should look like:</p>

While we are not going to go over those in detail, we want to reassure you that Clever Cloud is an Elastic official partner, and as such <strong>nothing</strong> changes for our customers. We will continue to support and extend our Elastic integration.</p>
<p><span id="more-2777"></span></p>
<p>Now that it has been cleared out let me tell you more about how we envision partnership at Clever Cloud. We believe that Cloud providers, as infrastructure providers, should be enablers of other Software Vendors. It might seem like a triviality but seeing how some other cloud providers behave, it seems unclear.</p>
<h2 id="responsabilities-as-a-service">Responsabilities as a Service</h2>
<p>A cloud provider is infrastructure. Infrastructure is a necessary condition to business. Being necessary can put you in an abusive position. It’s even more true when you have a monopolistic position on a market. Basically you can behave like a bully or a child.</p>
<p>If you want to address AWS or the Apple store users, you have to play by their rules. And the bigger they are the more they get to decide what rules apply. This also gives them power to retaliate.</p>
<p>They could for instance tell the world they are in a partnership with you while it’s false. Some will take it for granted because they don’t necessarily know you. Then offer the same service without giving back, capitalizing on all the efforts made by the vendor and its community.</p>
<p>Here we need to state that laws and regulations have always lagged behind innovation in the Software industry. This is partly the reason why we see new Software licences(AGPL, SSPL and the likes) being adopted to protect IPs or trademarks from possible abuse.</p>
<p>That’s not right. Usually supporters of these methods will answer something like “yes but it’s legal”. Resorting to this authority argument usually means you have nothing else to say and know you are losing ground on everything else. (and in Elastic’s case, the “it’s legal” argument hardly holds as AWS has been abusing Elastic’s trademark).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s about doing the right thing. Don’t be a bully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we think it’s important to do what’s right, we have always had the following approach towards Vendors.</p>
<p>Before providing anything as a service we propose a revenue sharing model: the vendor gets a cut of the money we made with the product. This is currently the best way we found to respect a cloud consumption/pay as you go model. Granted this goes against the traditional yearly subscription model and how sales teams traditionally operate. But we are talking about a partnership here.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-clever-cloud-bring-you">What can Clever Cloud bring you?</h2>
<p>If this is of interest to you let&#39;s go quickly over some Clever Cloud facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clever Cloud is a European company and as such is not subjected to the US Cloud Act.</li>
<li>It works as a public, private, hybrid or on-premises cloud, and is available on other public Cloud like OVH, and several others are planned this year.</li>
<li>As our infrastructure and orchestrator is proprietary we will manage all the product integration, which usually results in 0 integration cost for the vendor.</li>
<li>We will handle level1/level2 support.</li>
</ul>
<p>When integrating a product we make sure we don&#39;t require any help from the vendor, to result in us sending them money every quarter without any effort on their part. They should not have to engage resources. It’s our job to provide this for them. This situation is often reversed because of the monopolistic situation of the major Cloud providers.</p>
<p>Let it be known that we always come to vendors with this proposal when considering to add their product to our catalog. And we have had a wide range of reactions. From “why would you give me money this is open source” to “You need to buy this much upfront. If you can’t why don’t you ask your VCs to pitch in ?”. And everything you can think of in the middle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, Cloud providers must be <strong>enablers</strong> for software vendors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="our-technical-differencies">Our Technical Differencies</h2>
<p>Running a cloud platform is something technical and as such we have several specificity you may want to know about:</p>
<p>There is always a point in our conversation where we talk about how the vendor support team can only support us if we use this specific version of Linux. And as it turns out we use a different version than most. We rely on Exherbo, an upstream, source based distribution. Here&#39;s two main points to why.</p>
<p>Being upstream allows us to use the latest version of each software, with the latest security patches. Look there was a time where it was super important to be on a battle-tested version of X or y. Because the primary security issue was to avoid segfault. It was a software stability issue. it&#39;s 2021. Things have changed. The main security concern is to have your SSL library up to date to protect yourself from external attack. Take the heartbleed security bug for instance. Our infrastructure was long patched when this became a known issue.</p>
<p>Being source based allows us to be in control. We can patch all our infrastructure faster. And since we compile everything we make sure it&#39;s optimized for the hardware it runs on. Most other distributions are just compiled to support everything, so it&#39;s optimized for nothing. It&#39;s the price to pay for genericity.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why as a PaaS provider we encourage people to simply deploy their source code instead of an unoptimized binary. And why when we provide closed source solutions, we are more than happy to sign an NDA to access the sources and make sure it&#39;s compiled for our platform. In this process we are also more than happy to contribute anything we may find interesting.</p>
<h2 id="become-a-registered-isv">Become a Registered ISV</h2>
<p>Now you should have a fairly good understanding of our partnership vision, and the role we envision for Cloud providers in our global economy. If you are a software vendor looking for a partnership, we would be happy to talk 🙂</p>

<p><span id="more-2776"></span></p>
<p>It has been a change long in the making, we have a new documentation portal. New layout, new organization, new content but it&#39;s still available at the same place: <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/">https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/</a></p>
<p>The content still lives under <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/doc.clever-cloud.com/">https://github.com/CleverCloud/doc.clever-cloud.com/</a> and has been reorganized. We are, of course, always welcoming new contributions, whether it is for a single typo, filling an issue or a detailed tutorial. Guidelines are available on the <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/contribute/writing/">&#39;Writing new Content&#39; page</a>.</p>
<p>Please give us feedback. We would love to know what page is missing or what you would like to read.</p>
<p>A quick word about how it&#39;s made. We are using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to generate the website. The theme used for this website is also available on Github: <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/hugo-cc-doc-theme">https://github.com/CleverCloud/hugo-cc-doc-theme</a></p>
<p>One of the reasons for this choice is that we are selling white-label version of Clever Cloud, and our customers want their own documentation. This allows us to keep working on the same content and to offer them a quick and easy way to deploy their own documentation.</p>
<p>I would like to finish this post with a big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/valeriane_IT">Valeriane Venance</a> who started this project with me and made a good chunk of it, to the Clever Cloud team and to all our <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/doc.clever-cloud.com/graphs/contributors">contributors</a>.</p>

You will now be able to deploy applications and managed databases in Sydney, Singapore, Warsaw and Roubaix. And all these new zones are deployed on top of OVHcloud. This comes in additon to our existing Paris and Montreal zones.</p>
<p><span id="more-2981"></span></p>
<p>This was the mantra of the latest OVHcloud summit, it&#39;s all about the ecosystem, a vibrant, diverse, innovating ecosystem. We fully agree and as such we are really happy to provide to all our customers a complete PaaS offering on infrastructure provided by OVHcloud. </p>
<p>We realize that big companies sometimes make &#39;group&#39; decision when it comes to choosing a cloud provider. And we are happy to answer those many who chose OVHcloud.</p>
<p>While we think you should not put all your eggs in the same basket, it can also become quite expensive to manage different cloud providers. This is the perfect time to remind you that Clever Cloud is Multi-Cloud ready. We can run it on any bare metal infrastructure. It provides the same experience everywhere as there is only one version of our cloud.</p>
<h2 id="how">How!?</h2>
<h3 id="in-the-console">In the console</h3>
<p>When creating an application, in the Zone dropbox you should be able to select them:</p>
<figure style="position:relative;width:50%;height:auto;margin:0 auto">
  <img data-action="zoom"  alt="index of meetups in Kibana" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/create-app-zone.png"/><br />
</figure>
<p>In the information tab, you can change an existing zone to another and this will trigger a redeployment in the new zone:</p>
<figure style="position:relative;width:50%;height:auto;margin:0 auto">
  <img data-action="zoom"  alt="index of meetups in Kibana" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/change-zone-info.png"/><br />
</figure>
<h3 id="with-clever-tools">With Clever-Tools</h3>
<p>If you are using clever-tools, or the API, the region flag is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paris, France -&gt; par</li>
<li>Montréal, Canada -&gt; mtl</li>
<li>Singapore, Singapore -&gt; sgp</li>
<li>Roubaix, France -&gt; rbx</li>
<li>Warsaw, Poland -&gt; wsw</li>
<li>Sydney, Australia -&gt; syd</li>
</ul>
<p>So to create an application in the Sydney zone you have to run <code>clever create --type node --region syd myApp</code>.</p>
<p>Please let us know what you think about this, and where/with whom you would like our next zones to show up.</p>

<p><span id="more-2977"></span></p>
<p>As it turns out it&#39;s not that complicated. You need to get the permissions right, and to be aware of a listing option in S3 API. Let&#39;s see how to make this work on Clever Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-cellar-addon">Create a Cellar Addon</h2>
<p>Clever Cloud is a Platform as a Service. We provide many <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/">managed services</a> and one of them is Cellar, our S3 compatible storage. Assuming you already have an account, here&#39;s how to create a Cellar add-on.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-cli">Using the CLI</h3>
<p>Assuming you are already using <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools">clever-tools</a>, all you have to do is run <code>clever addon create cellar-addon --plan S myCellarService</code>.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-web-console">Using the Web Console</h3>
<p>You can login to our console on <code>https://console.clever-cloud.com/</code>. From there click on Create, an add-on and choose Cellar. There is only one plan available since Cellar is billed based on consumption so click next. We have no need to link it to an existing application so click next again, give it a name and click on create.</p>
<p><video width="70%" autoplay loop style="margin:0 auto;display: block;"><source src="//assets.clever-cloud.com/website/blog/create-cellar.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="//assets.clever-cloud.com/website/blog/create-cellar.webm" type="video/webm" /></video></p>
<h2 id="setup-a-bucket">Setup a Bucket</h2>
<p>Now that you have your S3 add-on, the easiest way to manage buckets is probably to use <a href="https://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> or <a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a>. Here&#39;s how to create a bucket, make it public and store some files.</p>
<p>First get your configuration file. It&#39;s waiting for you on the add-on dashboard. Browse your Cellar add-on from the console, you should see some details and a link to <code>Download a pre-filled s3cfg file.</code>. Download it and place it under your home directory. If you are a linux user it should be <code>~/.s3cfg</code>.</p>
<p><video width="70%" autoplay loop style="margin:0 auto;display: block;"><source src="//assets.clever-cloud.com/website/blog/get-cellar-conf.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="//assets.clever-cloud.com/website/blog/get-cellar-conf.webm" type="video/webm" /></video></p>
<p>Now s3cmd will use this configuration. Nothing else to do. Typing <code>s3cmd la</code> list all resources available. If you just created the Cellar add-on, you should see nothing listed. To create your bucket run <code>s3cmd mb s3://your-unique-bucket-name/</code>. The chosen name should be lower case and unique. If I insist on the uniqueness of that name, it&#39;s because it can&#39;t be already taken by someone else. All buckets are made available by default on <code>http://your-unique-bucket-name.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com</code>. You can see why they have to be unique.</p>
<p>You can also name it after your domain name, and put a CNAME redirection to <code>cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com.</code>. This way it will be available from your domain name directly. You will find more information on <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/cellar/">our documenation</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have created your bucket, you are ready to upload your files. Run <code>s3cmd sync ./ s3://your-unique-bucket-name/</code> and the content of the current folder will be automatically updated to your bucket.</p>
<p>By default everything is private so if you browse <code>http://your-unique-bucket-name.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com</code> you should get an XML error saying access denied. To change this and make it readable by everyone, run <code>s3cmd setacl --acl-public s3://your-unique-bucket-name/*</code>. This will grant read access to all anonymous users.</p>
<p>Each file should be accessible separately but you still cannot list the content of the bucket. This is because the bucket itself has to be set to public. Run <code>s3cmd setacl --acl-public s3://your-unique-bucket-name</code> and it will allow you to see the list of objects as XML. You can get a simpler list by adding <code>type-list=2</code> as query param. So by browsing <a href="http://your-unique-bucket-name.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/?type-list=2">http://your-unique-bucket-name.cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com/?type-list=2</a>, you should see something like:</p>

<p>You can of course adjust the permissions to your liking. Not everything has to be public. You can make that listing look much better and be actually browsable. Here&#39;s how.</p>
<h2 id="add-the-listing">Add the Listing</h2>
<p>As you have seen it&#39;s easy to get an XML list of your bucket content. You will find many examples on GitHub of single page HTML that fetch the XML list with an XHR request and then renders it nicely. All you have to do is usually upload that files at the root of your bucket and everything should work.</p>
<p>I have tried with <a href="https://github.com/qoomon/aws-s3-bucket-browser">https://github.com/qoomon/aws-s3-bucket-browser</a> and it works great. Simply clone this repo and upload all the files at the root of your bucket with the public ACL.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/qoomon/aws-s3-bucket-browser/
s3cmd put --acl-public aws-s3-bucket-browser/favicon.ico s3://your-unique-bucket-name/favicon.ico

<p><span id="more-2831"></span></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>You are writing an application that depends on a <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a> cluster. The moment comes when you need to put your code into production. During the early development of your application you were running a ZooKeeper instance on your laptop. Now that you are deploying to production, you need a secure connection between your app and the production ZooKeeper cluster you just set up.</p>
<p>Reading the <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.1/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_authOptions" title="ZooKeeper authentication options">ZooKeeper documentation</a> you learn that you can achieve that through multiple ways: X509, SASL Kerberos, SASL Digest. Since you just want to demonstrate your POC, you have no wish to take on the burden of using X509 client certificates or to deploy a Kerberos architecture. So you fallback to SASL Digest. It&#39;s simple and easy, it&#39;s a user/password pair like you are used to.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Client-Server+mutual+authentication#ClientServermutualauthentication-ClientConfiguration" title="ZK Auth">some more documentation</a> you learn that you have to put the credentials in a jaas.conf file. You then look into <em>the internet</em> to find a way to bypass this requirement.</p>
<p>Well, your search is over, your quest ends with this very article!</p>
<p>You just want to copy some code and don&#39;t care about the whole &quot;let&#39;s talk about X&quot; part? Jump to the <a href="#how-to-get-rid-of-jaas-config-file">&quot;How to get rid of jaas.config file&quot;</a> section!</p>
<h2 id="some-explanations-first">Some explanations first</h2>
<p>Since Java 1.4, a security framework has been added to the JRE: the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/security/java-authentication-and-authorization-service-jaas-reference-guide.html#GUID-FA47090A-D270-4E4E-A5F6-752E1A48DC4C" title="JAAS Official doc">Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)</a>.</p>
<p>JAAS is a quite comprehensive and pluggable framework. The only downside is that it&#39;s thought as a service meant to authenticate &quot;the user running the code&quot;. So it has a tendency to use configuration files or even system JVM configuration.</p>
<p>Configuration based on files containing secrets is a growing no-go in the cloud era. Since most clouds rely on disposable systems, using a JAAS file means one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>commiting the file, with the secrets in it;</li>
<li>commiting a file and use pre-run hooks to set the right value in it;</li>
<li>running an external service that would provide this file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution 1 is a strict no-go. Solution 2 is doable, but as a developer, I don&#39;t like having to resort to such practices. However, it&#39;s still better than solution 1, I&#39;m just stating my very personal point on view! Solution 3 is a bit like solution 2. It needs some kind of pre-run hook. In addition, it needs to trust the external source.</p>
<p>In this article, we will see how to abstract ourselves from the file-based JAAS login configuration. I will use a ZooKeeper Java/Scala client as an example.</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-the-box-jaas-file">What&#39;s in the <del>box</del> JAAS file?</h2>
<p>First, what is a JAAS file made of?</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jgss/tutorials/LoginConfigFile.html">Oracle documentation</a> states, it is made of <em>entries</em>. Each <em>entry</em> is composed of multiple <em>modules</em>. Each <em>module</em> provides a login/authorization mechanism with all its options. An authentication/authorization process has to satisfy all <em>modules</em> of the <em>entry</em> to succeed.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>We assume that the server part is already configured. Here we focus on the client part only.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we want to authenticate a Java application against a ZooKeeper cluster using the DIGEST-MD5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer" title="Wikipedia SASL">SASL</a> mechanism. We write a jaas.conf file somewhere on the filesystem. Here is what the file content will look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Client {
   org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestLoginModule required
   username=&quot;buffysummers&quot;
   password=&quot;vampiresbeware&quot;;
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>entry</em> name is <code>Client</code> (the default client session name for ZooKeeper). There is one module identified by the FQDN of the <code>LoginModule</code> class that will process the authentication/authorization. This module is <code>required</code> and has two parameters: <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>. No spaces around the <code>=</code>, the semicolon separates the modules. So only one is needed at the end of the module. One is also needed after the entry.</p>
<p>&quot;Executing&quot; this entry is quite straightforward: Java instanciates the <code>org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestLoginModule</code> class and calls <code>initialize(&quot;subject&quot;, callback, sharedState, Map(username=buffysummers, password=vampirebeware))</code> on the instance. After that, the actual client will use the instance&#39;s methods to perform authentication/authorization.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the developer&#39;s responsibility to ensure the module class is present in the classpath. In the case of ZooKeeper, the library provides the <code>org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestLoginModule</code> class.</p>
<p>Oh, one last thing about the JAAS file syntax: for each <em>module</em> you must say if the module is required, sufficient, optional, etc. That&#39;s what the <code>required</code> keyword is about! That way you can require multiple authentication methods to pass or you can just ask for one of them to pass.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-in-the-jvm">How does it work in the JVM?</h3>
<p>When running your application, the client code will use the <code>javax.security.auth.login.Configuration</code> static class to access your configured JAAS. Actually, it will use the only JRE provided implementation <code>com.sun.security.auth.login.ConfigFile</code>, which parses your provided jaas.conf file.</p>
<p>The Configuration singleton provides one method, <code>getAppConfigurationEntry(String entryName)</code>. In our example, by default, the ZooKeeper client calls the method with the string &quot;Client&quot;.</p>
<p>In most JREs, there is no default JAAS file. That means <code>Configuration</code> has no entries.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-tell-the-jvm-where-to-find-jaasconf">How do I tell the JVM where to find jaas.conf?</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/jdk.security.auth/com/sun/security/auth/login/ConfigFile.html" title="Javadoc ConfigFile">the javadoc</a>, there are multiple ways to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>edit the java.security system file (in <code>$JAVA_HOME</code>);</li>
<li>run your app with the java option <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=path/to/jaas.conf</code>;</li>
<li>put the file in the default location: <code>$HOME/.java.login.config</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next section will show us how to setup your JVM using Java code, without relying on the filesystem. It will keep on using the ZooKeeper client example.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-rid-of-jaasconfig-file">How to get rid of jaas.config file</h2>
<p>The answer to that is quite simple: override Java&#39;s Configuration default implementation!</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we dive in the details, please note that <strong>There is only one Configuration object installed in the runtime at any given time</strong>. When we override it, we remove all previous login configurations. Most JREs do not have any default configuration, so you should be safe. However, if you deploy your application in your company&#39;s VMs or container, they may already have specific configuration. So ask around!</p>
<h3 id="implementing-a-new-configuration">Implementing a new Configuration</h3>
<p>First, we define a class that implements javax.security.auth.login.Configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import javax.security.auth.login.AppConfigurationEntry;
import javax.security.auth.login.Configuration;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MyConfiguration extends Configuration {
   AppConfigurationEntry[] getAppConfigurationEntry(s: String) {
      Map&lt;String,String&gt; options = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
      options.put(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;buffysummers&quot;);
      options.put(&quot;password&quot;, &quot;vampiresbeware&quot;);

      return {
         new AppConfigurationEntry(
               &quot;org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestLoginModule&quot;,
               AppConfigurationEntry.LoginModuleControlFlag.REQUIRED,
               options
               )
      };
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you are highly encouraged to get the values for <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> from the environment, from a config database, or whatever you want! You might even add a constructor and feed it the credentials. You do you!</p>
<p>The next step is to instanciate it. You need to do it before you create a new ZooKeeper client instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// 1. Do that somewhere *before* creating the ZooKeeper instance.
// I would say do it close enough so other people can understand why you do it, or
// document this call because it is kind of cryptic.
Configuration.setConfiguration(new MyConfiguration());

// 2. Just create the zookeeper instance as usual!
ZooKeeper zookeeper = new ZooKeeper(&quot;localhost:2181&quot;, 3600000, watchCallback);

// 3. ?

// 4. PROFIT!
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#39;s it.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-method">Alternative method</h2>
<p>When writing this article, I read the documentation a bit more in depth and found out that I could use Java properties in the JAAS configuration file!</p>
<p>So instead of the code-only solution, we could actually just commit a jaas.conf file containing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Client {
   org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.DigestLoginModule required
   username=&quot;${app.zookeeper.username}&quot;
   password=&quot;${app.zookeeper.password}&quot;;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Then run your Java application with the Java options: <code>-Dapp.zookeeper.username=buffysummers</code> and <code>-Dapp.zookeeper.password=vampirebeware</code>.</p>
<p>I tried it, it works!</p>
<p>Depending on your application, using this solution might be easier than the full-code one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now that we understand a bit more about JAAS and how to avoid using the file format, there is actually only one advice to keep in mind: <strong>DO NOT STORE CREDENTIALS IN YOUR GIT REPOSITORY!</strong> By using one of the two proposed solutions, you should be able to have the secrets provided by the environment.</p>
<p>Besides, both of them should work on Clever Cloud. Your environment variables are injected in your application both as environement and as Java properties! You can also define a variable named <code>app.zookeeper.username</code>. It will only appear as a Java property, due to limitations in environment variables names.</p>

Let&#39;s see how 🙂</p>
<p><span id="more-2830"></span></p>
<p>For years the only way to deploy a static website on Clever Cloud was to create an application. While the type of this application says static, it&#39;s in fact a PHP application in disguise. The good thing about this is it allows you to play with Apache&#39;s configuration to manage custom redirection and the likes. But sometimes you don&#39;t need any flexibility. And you don&#39;t want to pay for an application running when you don&#39;t need one.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/cellar/">Cellar</a>, our S3 compatible object storage. You can use it to serve static assets. By default it uses the Cellar cluster URL, but with the right CNAME redirection and naming convention, it will serve your website behind your own custom domain. Cellar prices are available in <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/cellar/#clever-cloud-cellar-plans">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works.</p>
<h2 id="domain-redirection">Domain Redirection</h2>
<p>To redirect your domain name to Clever Cloud&#39;s server, go to your domain name registrar dashboard and select the domain you want to redirect. In my case it&#39;s <code>ldoguin.name</code> on OVHCloud.</p>
<figure style="position:relative;width:100%;height:auto;margin:0 auto">
  <img data-action="zoom"  alt="Domain CNAME redirection" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/ovh-cname-redirect.png"/><br />
</figure>
<p>You need to add a CNAME redirection to our Cellar&#39;s CNAME: <code>cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com.</code> CNAME redirection are not available for root domains. If you want to redirect a root domain you will need all the public IPs of our cluster. You can easily get them by typing <code>dig cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com</code> in a terminal.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-bucket">Create the Bucket</h2>
<p>Once you have redirected your domain name to the Cellar cluster, create the Cellar add-on and add a new bucket named after your domain name, in my case <code>blog.ldoguin.name</code>.</p>
<p>An auto-renewed Let&#39;s Encrypt certificate will be setup automatically shortly after the bucket creation.</p>
<p>Everything you will upload to this bucket will be served as a static file.</p>
<h2 id="upload-your-site">Upload your Site</h2>
<p>If you already have your files ready, my favorite solution to upload them is to use <a href="https://rclone.org">rclone</a>. It&#39;s great to sync your files to many different cloud storage from Cellar to S3, Google drive, Swift, Dropbox and more.</p>
<p>Assuming all the files are in a folder called <code>public</code> and that you have a configured connection to Cellar called <code>mys3</code>, this is what you need to type:</p>
<p><code>rclone sync ./public mys3:blog.ldoguin.name --progress --s3-acl=public-read</code></p>
<p>This is pretty much rsync but for cloud storage 🙂 To configure my connection I had the following environment variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$CELLAR_ADDON_KEY_ID
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$CELLAR_ADDON_KEY_SECRET
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ENDPOINT=$CELLAR_ADDON_HOST
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=&quot;s3&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I copied them from the my Cellar add-on dashboard. We could stop here. You have a static website hosted on Clever Cloud without a running application. Let&#39;s take this a bit further by using an application to build the website.</p>
<h2 id="build-and-upload-your-static-site">Build and Upload your Static Site</h2>
<p>I wrote about Hugo in a <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2020/06/18/deploy-static-site-hugo/">previous post</a>. This is going to be almost similar so I&#39;ll be quick.</p>
<p>The plan is to create a Clever Cloud application. Each time you will push new content to this application, it will start, generate the Hugo website, upload it to Cellar then stop itself.</p>
<p>Assuming you have installed Hugo and clever-tools, this is everything you need to do to have a generated website:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir hugo-cellar-static # Create the site root folder
cd hugo-cellar-static/
hugo new site . # Generate a new Hugo site
git init # initialize the git repository
git submodule add https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex themes/codex # add a theme
cp themes/codex/exampleSite/config.toml config.toml # copy the default configuration
cp -r themes/codex/exampleSite/content/ . # copy default content for the exemple
gedit config.toml  # edit the configuration, like the theme or the baseUrl
clever create --type static-apache myapp # Create a new clever cloud application
clever service link-addon MyCellar # link the app to the Cellar add-on
cat ~/.config/clever-cloud  # Get the clever-tools token
</code></pre>
<p>At that point you should have created a website structure and a Clever Cloud application. These are the environment variables needed to configure it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">CC_PHP_VERSION=&quot;7&quot;
CC_PRE_RUN_HOOK=&quot;./hugo.sh&quot; # A prerun hook to execute the build and sync it to Cellar
CC_RUN_SUCCEEDED_HOOK=&quot;clever stop&quot; # use clever-tools to turn off the app when finished
CLEVER_SECRET=&quot;xxxx&quot; # Tokens for clever-tools
CLEVER_TOKEN=&quot;xxxxx&quot; # Tokens for clever-tools
DL_RCLONE_VERSION=&quot;1.52.1&quot; # which version of rclone to use
HUGO_VERSION=&quot;0.62.0&quot; # which version of hugo to use
MY_DOMAIN=&quot;blog.ldoguin.name/&quot; # The name of the bucket to sync
PORT=&quot;8080&quot;
HUGO_ENV=&quot;production&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>clever stop</code> trick is likely to be replaced by something cleaner in the coming weeks, with something like a task or job. The build and sync of the site is done when the pre run hook executes <code>hugo.sh</code>, which has the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Configure rclone Cellar connection
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$CELLAR_ADDON_KEY_ID
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$CELLAR_ADDON_KEY_SECRET
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ENDPOINT=$CELLAR_ADDON_HOST
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=&quot;s3&quot;

# Download and unpack rclone and hugo
wget https://downloads.rclone.org/v$DL_RCLONE_VERSION/rclone-v$DL_RCLONE_VERSION-linux-amd64.zip
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v$HUGO_VERSION/hugo_extended_&quot;$HUGO_VERSION&quot;_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
unzip rclone-v$DL_RCLONE_VERSION-linux-amd64.zip
tar xvf hugo_extended_&quot;$HUGO_VERSION&quot;_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

# Execute the site generation with Hugo
chmod +x ./hugo
./hugo --gc --minify

# Sync the site to Cellar
./rclone-v$DL_RCLONE_VERSION-linux-amd64/rclone sync ./public mys3:$MY_DOMAIN --progress --s3-acl=public-read
</code></pre>
<p>Now what&#39;s left to do is add and commit all the files and deploy.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git add .  # add the current folder to git
git commit -m&quot;init&quot; # commit
clever deploy # Deploy your website
</code></pre>
<p>The application will start, generate the website and sync it to Cellar then stop itself. So there it is you will still have your website running, but without running an application.</p>
<p>Please let us know what you think and what kind of features you would like to see supported for static sites 🙂</p>

We decided to use the Hugo static site generator to make it available online. This post explains how we deployed it.</p>
<p><span id="more-2829"></span></p>
<p>There are many technical solutions out there to host your podcast, like Ausha or Anchor. They will allow you to configure everything needed and upload your material so you get a proper RSS feed in the end. Because Podcast subscribtions are basically RSS feed subscribtions. And these services can also go the extra mile and automatically distribute your podcast to other sites. This is actually the main reason why we use Ausha. It&#39;s way easier.</p>
<p>That being said we still want to have a dedicated page on our existing website and host the RSS and media files ourselves. And it turns out there is a great <a href="https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet">Hugo theme</a> for podcast hosting.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> it&#39;s one of the most popular static site generator. It&#39;s fast, mature, loaded with cool features and still in active development. Community is super helpful and you will find many different themes for different purposes like blog, documentation, FAQ or even podcast.</p>
<p>To follow along you need to install git, hugo and <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools">clever-tools</a>. Let&#39;s see how this works.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-hugo-website">Create a new Hugo website</h2>
<p>Creating a new Hugo website is pretty straightforward. Create a folder to contain your site and inside it run <code>hugo new site</code>. Then you can add the theme you want as a submodule, copy the theme sample configuration and you should be ready to start working on your site. Here&#39;s what I did:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir mysite
cd mysite
hugo new site .
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet themes/castanet
cp themes/castanet/exampleSite/config.toml config.toml
git add .
git commit -m&#39;init&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>From here you can run <code>hugo server</code> and your site will be available at <code>localhost:1313</code>, with automatic reloading and file modification watching. This command will fail because it cannot find the theme. No worries, it&#39;s because we copied the config file from the theme directory, and its theme folder location is hardcoded. We don&#39;t need it anymore. So go ahead and edit <code>config.toml</code>. Start by removing or commenting <code>themesdir</code> on line 6. Then add your own configuration and create new content. I have set the baseUrl to <code>clever-cloud.com/fr/podcast</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that this is not a traditional baseUrl as it&#39;s assuming something else is already running on clever-cloud.com. And this is fine, Clever Cloud knows how to manage this. From here you can add some content and finish your own configuration. Then it&#39;s time to deploy on Clever Cloud.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-to-clever-cloud">Deploy to Clever Cloud</h2>
<p> At the root of your website create a file called <code>hugo.sh</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v$HUGO_VERSION/hugo_extended_&quot;$HUGO_VERSION&quot;_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar xvf hugo_extended_&quot;$HUGO_VERSION&quot;_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
chmod +x ./hugo
./hugo --gc --minify --destination public/fr/podcast
</code></pre>
<p>Don&#39;t forget to make it executable with <code>chmod +x hugo.sh</code>, add and commit it. This script will be executed by Clever Cloud thanks to our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-cloud-overview/hooks/">deployment hooks</a>. It downloads Hugo with the version you specified in the environment variables then run the build of the website. The build destination is specified manually as <code>public/fr/podcast</code>, the default would be <code>public</code>. This is because we need to serve the content on <em>clever-cloud.com/fr/podcast</em> and not just <em>clever-cloud.com</em>.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s use clever-tools to create, configure and deploy the application. In the terminal run the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">clever create --type static-apache mysite
clever domain add clever-cloud.com/fr/podcast
clever config set force-https enabled
clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK &quot;./hugo.sh&quot;
clever env set CC_WEBROOT &quot;/public&quot;
clever env set HUGO_ENV &quot;production&quot;
clever env set HUGO_VERSION &quot;0.68.3&quot;
clever deploy
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the application on Clever Cloud, add the custom domain <code>clever-cloud.com/fr/podcast</code>, and yes this works even though we already have an application serving <code>clever-cloud.com</code>. The new domain will take precedence. Then we enforce HTTPS redirection and set a bunch of environment variable for our configuration. Last command deploys the website to Clever Cloud. From here you should see logs popping up.</p>
<p>And this is it. You have deployed a static website in production that will be updated automatically each time you push new content, on top of an existing website. Please let us know if you have any questions about static site deployment.</p>

<p>Created in 2015 with the idea of allowing everyone to deliver their neighbor&#39;s groceries, <a href="https://www.shopopop.com/">Shopopop</a> now counts more than 300&#160;000 users. After 2 years of testing, it really was in 2017 that the company started its growth with about 20% more per month since the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="300-000-users---------400-000-deliveries-----40-collaborators"><center><strong>300&#160;000 Users         400&#160;000 Deliveries     40 Collaborators</strong></center></h3>
<h2 id="a-rapid-increase-in-activity-without-any-stress">A rapid increase in activity… without any stress</h2>
<p>During the Covid-19 period the demand for home delivery has exploded. Shopopop has been recognized as a public utility by the Ministry of the Economy of France, which has given them a big boost. Some of their click and collect partners have multiplied their activity by 10 in terms of delivery. During the first two days, the customer service was completely underwater but the entire collaborator team was mobilized to help them.</p>
<h2 id="antoine-how-did-you-experience-this-atypical-period-for-your-company">Antoine, How did you experience this atypical period for your company?</h2>
<p>These months were very intense but we were able to adapt quickly, the organization went very well, all our teams were very responsive and we all knew how to help each other.</p>
<p>Unusual fact for us: we had to hire without meeting and integrating our future collaborators in real life during lockdown! Today we can&#39;t wait to go back to the office normally and to be able to celebrate the fact that we stood our ground and that everything went well.</p>
<h2 id="with-this-rapid-growth-have-you-been-worried-that-your-infrastructure-will-saturate">With this rapid growth, have you been worried that your infrastructure will saturate?</h2>
<p>From 2015 to 2017 we were using another cloud provider and we had a lot of crashes. Since 2017, we have been using Clever Cloud and we can re-focus on the value of our app and the comfort of our users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clever Cloud service allowed us to be very calm despite the threefold increase of our activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We didn&#39;t have to do anything on the infrastructure part and the technical support was very responsive when we encountered bugs. All segments (payment, data, visits) held up, and this is all the more important in this type of situation.</p>
<p>The fact that we are hosted in France greatly reassures our customers, it is a guarantee of quality, of seriousness. Everything in relation to GDPR is a real issue for our partners.</p>
<h2 id="whats-coming-for-shopopop">What’s coming for Shopopop?</h2>
<p>One of our main challenges is to open up internationally, to allow us to grow. We have a lot of topics underway for our internationalization, but it will always be less insane than a threefold increase in three days. We are confident in our future, in the fact that our infrastructure will take the shock and also that it will increase in costs gradually.</p>
<p><em>Thank you Antoine for your time, hope to see you soon!</em></p>

Today let&#39;s follow a simple deployment tutorial for Phoenix applications.</p>
<p><span id="more-2828"></span></p>
<h2 id="step-1-creating-a-new-phoenix-application">Step 1: Creating a new Phoenix Application</h2>
<p>If you follow this tutorial, I assume you already have Elixir and Phoenix&#39;s dependencies installed locally. If you don&#39;t, you will probably want to read <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>To create a brand-new Phoenix application locally, we just need to type in our terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mix phx.new &lt;your application&#39;s name&gt; # creating the new phoenix project
$ cd &lt;your application&#39;s name&gt;
$ mix ecto.create # creating database locally
</code></pre>
<p>Creating the database locally isn&#39;t crucial for this tutorial, but it can help if you want to code on your machine.</p>
<h3 id="note-to-osx-users">Note to OSX users</h3>
<p>If you use OSX like me, you may encounter this error: <code>(Postgrex.Error) FATAL 28000 (invalid_authorization_specification) role &quot;postgres&quot; does not exist</code>. This is because when installing PostgreSQL with brew, it creates a user with your short name, not <code>postgres</code>. To fix this, open the project with your favorite text editor and replace <code>username: &quot;postgres&quot;,</code> by <code>username: &quot;&lt;your name&gt;&quot;,</code> in the file <code>config/dev.exs</code>. For instance, my name is <code>valeriane venance</code> in my computer so I replace with <code>username: &quot;valeriane&quot;,</code>.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-getting-our-application-ready-for-production">Step 2: Getting our Application Ready for Production</h2>
<p>From the code perspective, all we need to do is to edit <code>config/prod.secret.exs</code> to replace <code>System.get_env(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;)</code> with <code>System.get_env(&quot;POSTGRESQL_ADDON_URI&quot;)</code>. This is because we will use the PostgreSQL add-on environment variable provided by Clever Cloud to your application instead of the default value.</p>
<p>Back in our terminal, we will generate a secret token that we will save for later with <code>$ mix phx.gen.secret</code> and check our elixir version with <code>$ elixir -v</code>.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it. Easy right? Now let&#39;s go into our Clever Cloud console.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-creating-the-prod-application-and-database">Step 3: Creating the Prod Application and Database</h2>
<p>If you already are a Clever Cloud user, these steps must be really familiar to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under the organization of your choice, click new, then application. Select <strong>Elixir</strong>, then name your application and choose its deployment zone.</li>
<li>When prompted if you need an add-on, select <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. Select your database size and name it.</li>
<li>On the environment variable screen create two new ones:</li>
<li><strong>SECRET_KEY_BASE</strong> with the value obtained from <code>$ mix phx.gen.secret</code> previously</li>
<li><strong>CC_ELIXIR_VERSION</strong> with the value of <code>$ elixir -v</code> result. (Available values as of today are <code>1.8</code>, <code>1.9</code> or <code>1.10</code>)</li>
<li>Click on <strong>update changes</strong></li>
<li>Bonus: if you have migrations to run you could also set the environment variable <strong>CC_PHOENIX_RUN_ECTO_MIGRATE</strong> to <code>true</code> to trigger the command <code>$ mix ecto.migrate</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-4-deploy">Step 4: deploy!</h2>
<p>Once the previous steps are made, Clever Cloud will provide you a git remote and the commands to add the remote and to push your code. If you had not done it before, initialize a new git repository in your terminal with <code>git init</code>. Then add and commit your code. Now you should be able to copy and paste the provided git commands. If you go back to your Clever Cloud console, you will see that your deployment has started and logs should show up. Wait a few moments and your application will be up and running. You can visit it by clicking the link icon on top of your application&#39;s menu in the Clever Cloud console.</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-explained">The magic explained</h2>
<p>As Phoenix is a framework that was built to be as easy to use as RubyOnRails but less <em>magical</em>, let&#39;s demystify what just happened here.</p>
<p>When we push our code to the remote Clever Cloud provided, the following commands are run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mix deps.get
$ mix deps.compile
$ npm install
</code></pre>
<p>These commands will compile your dependencies at the root of your project folder. If you want to use another folder for <code>npm install</code>, specify it via the environment variable <strong>CC_PHOENIX_ASSETS_DIR</strong>. To change the folder for the entire build/run process, you should use the <strong>APP_FOLDER</strong> environment variable.</p>
<p>Then <code>$ mix compile</code> is run. If you want to override this behavior, you can set the environment variable <strong>CC_MIX_BUILD_GOAL</strong> to the value you desire.</p>
<p>At this point, there is the command <code>$ npm run deploy</code>.</p>
<p>Then <code>$ mix phx.digest</code> is run. You can override this one with the variable <strong>CC_PHOENIX_DIGEST_GOAL</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>$ mix phx.server</code> is invoked, and as always, you can override this behavior, either with <strong>CC_RUN_COMMAND</strong> where you have to specify the full command, or <strong>CC_PHOENIX_SERVER_GOAL</strong> where it will be a mix task by default.</p>
<p>If you need to specify the time zone of your application, you can do it with the variable <strong>TZ</strong> set to the usual time zone format, for instance <code>Europe/Paris</code>.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s it really, now you have your Phoenix application deployed to production. All you have to do left is write code, commit and push it again! Happy hacking!</p>

No more .htaccess black magic, no redirection handling code…  Let&#39;s have a tour of this new feature.</p>
<p><span id="more-2975"></span></p>
<h2 id="forcing-https-on-clever-cloud">Forcing HTTPS on Clever Cloud</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start practical. There are two ways to achieve our goal.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-cli">Using the CLI</h3>
<p>In your linked application, in your own terminal just type in <code>clever config set force-https enabled</code>.</p>
<p><code>clever config</code> is a new CLI command that allows you to display in your console the current configuration of your application. You can edit any setting with <code>clever config set {name} {value}</code> and bulk edit with <code>clever config update [options]</code>.</p>
<p>Here we just set the force https option to <strong>enabled</strong> and if we want to set if off we can just <code>clever config set force-https disabled</code>.</p>
<p>If this does not work for you, make sure you are running version 2.5.0 or newer (with <code>clever version</code>).</p>
<h3 id="using-the-clever-cloud-console">Using the Clever Cloud console</h3>
<p>In the information page of each application, you will find a checkbox form with options you can tune in and out. One of them is <strong>Force HTTPS</strong>. Enable its checkbox and save.</p>
<figure>
  <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/enable-https.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img style="width:100%" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/enable-https.png"></a><br />
</figure>
<p>From now on and as long as you do not disable it, every non-secured HTTP request to this application will be redirected to HTTPS with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301">301 Moved Permanently</a> status code.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-magic-happens">How the magic happens</h2>
<h3 id="the-clever-cloud-way">The Clever Cloud way</h3>
<p>The redirection is handled at the reverse proxy level so you don&#39;t need to update your application to use it. Each time the browser will request a resource using HTTP, it will get a 301 response back with the same resource prefixed by <code>https</code> in the Location header field. The 301 redirection is recognized as the best practice for HTTPS upgrade.</p>
<figure>
  <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/force-https-schema.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img style="width:100%" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/force-https-schema.png"></a><br />
</figure>
<h2 id="why-enforce-https">Why enforce HTTPS</h2>
<p>Before explaining why it is important, I shall provide a definition of HTTPS.</p>
<h3 id="simple-definition">Simple definition</h3>
<p>First of all, HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP protocol. Which itself is the application protocol the world wide web is relying on for communications. Full definition to be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The main difference between HTTP and HTTPS communication is encryption.</p>
<p>Using HTTPS, the communication is bidirectionaly encrypted between the client and the server. Both the headers and the response/request data are ciphered. This is achieved using TLS cryptographic protocol in addition to operations involved in a simple HTTP transmission.</p>
<p>The identification process requires the server administrator to create a public key certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority.</p>
<p>We have automated this part. So every time you create a new application on Clever Cloud, a cleverapps.io subdomain name is given to your application and comes along with encryption because a certificate covers cleverapps.io and all its subdomains. And each time you add a custom domain to your application like <code>example.com</code>, Clever Cloud asks Let&#39;s Encrypt for a TLS public key certificate that we automatically add to your application&#39;s configuration on our reverse proxies. Thanks to that, you can accept HTTPS requests on a brand new application without further configuration.</p>
<h3 id="enforcing-https-is-just-the-beginning">Enforcing HTTPS is just the beginning</h3>
<p>I explained to you how HTTPS enforcing was working on Clever Cloud and that felt very simple, right?</p>
<p>To be honest this is because the tech team has decided only to handle the first step of the process.</p>
<p>Strong security on an application requires knowledge on many topics.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your application itself will link to HTTP content, which will result in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content">mixed-content</a>. When HTTP resources are served by the application on a page requested using HTTPS the browser will usually not load those resources.</p>
<p>You will also probably want to know more about HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header.</p>
<p>You can start by reading <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/migrating-from-http-to-https-ease-the-pain-with-csp-and-hsts/">this great article from Scott Helme</a> to start your journey. If you cannot handle advanced security yourself, think about asking for the help of a security expert.</p>
<h2 id="https-is-good-for-everyone-except-hackers">HTTPS is good for everyone, except hackers</h2>
<p>In 2020 the HTTPS protocol is ubiquitous. It&#39;s more and more widely used thanks to the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> initiative which made it free for everyone; which makes the web more secure for both applications creators and clients.</p>
<p>The clients know they can trust the integrity of the content that&#39;s being displayed to them and feel safer about using the Internet in general. This safety feeling extends to their privacy. Today the regular user&#39;s main concern is about what the owner of the website do with their data. Not about that black hooded bad guy they were freaking out about a few years ago. The most used websites have raised their confidence about communications ciphering to such a level it&#39;s now the norm. Everyone puts credit-card numbers in forms eyes wide shut.</p>
<p>Yeah, but me ? Having a website to offer to the world, I want to meet my client’s expectations, of course. But HTTPS has more to offer me. From the SEO perspective, having it will naturally boost ranking. I also ensure my user&#39;s privacy and confidentiality. Most importantly, I can trust that the data I receive from my client has not been altered. That doesn’t mean that I shall trust my user intentions obviously. But now if I need to watch out for a hacker, it will not come from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man in the middle</a> or this kind of attack.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is everywhere now and already almost mandatory. Take this train now! This feature is free, does not require extra code and works out of the box with the automatically generated Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates.</p>

<p>In the documentation only three implementations are demonstrated and they all rely on cloud services. Today I am going to show you how to use it to be Clever Cloud compatible.</p>
<p><span id="more-2827"></span></p>
<p>To follow this tutorial you must already have a Rails &gt;= 5.2 application running on Clever Cloud with a PostgreSQL database. You can <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2019/05/07/setup-your-ruby-on-rails-online-dev-environment/">read this</a> if you need a basic setup.</p>
<h2 id="tell-rails-you-want-to-use-active-storage">Tell Rails you want to use Active Storage</h2>
<p>In your console, at the root of your rails project repository, type in <code>$ rails active_storage:install</code>. This will create two migration files under <code>./db/migrate</code>. These migrations will create two new tables: <code>active_storage_blobs</code> and <code>active_storage_attachments</code>, which is everything we need to start storing user attachments without adding new columns to our already existent models. Let&#39;s run them with <code>$ rake db:migrate</code> to have a local database up to date. You can now use <code>has_one_attached :&lt;the name you want to give&gt;</code> on any of your models to add an attachment on it.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-application-for-clever-cloud">Setting up the application for Clever Cloud</h2>
<p>As we do provide AWS S3 like storage at Clever Cloud, we will use AWS gem and define custom endpoints. Add <code>gem &quot;aws-sdk-s3&quot;, require: false</code> to your Gemfile. Run <code>$ bundle install</code>. Then in <code>config/environments/production.yml</code> add <code>config.active_storage.service = :clevercloud</code>. Now in <code>config/storage.yml</code> add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">clevercloud:
  service: S3
  access_key_id: &lt;%= ENV[&#39;CELLAR_ADDON_KEY_ID&#39;] %&gt;
  secret_access_key: &lt;%= ENV[&#39;CELLAR_ADDON_KEY_SECRET&#39;] %&gt;
  region: us-east-1
  bucket: &lt;%= ENV[&#39;CELLAR_ADDON_BUCKET_NAME&#39;] %&gt;
  endpoint: &lt;%= ENV[&#39;CELLAR_ADDON_ENDPOINT&#39;] %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I must make clear here that we do not use regions at Clever Cloud, but the aws-sdk-s3 gem needs it; otherwise it throws an <code>AWS::Errors::MissingRegionError</code> error. And we do not want a 500 in production. It is the usage of <code>endpoint</code> that will give us the right endpoint generated by the gem.</p>
<h2 id="creating-our-storage-on-clever-cloud">Creating our storage on Clever Cloud</h2>
<p>Under the organization where your Rails application is deployed, select <strong>Create</strong>, <strong>an add-on</strong>, <strong>Cellar S3 storage</strong>. When prompted <strong>Select the applications that will use this add-on:</strong> select your Rails application. Name it and let it be deployed. Once this is done, in your <strong>addon dashboard</strong>, create a bucket. Keep its name. Now, under <strong>Environment variables</strong> in your Rails application, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">CELLAR_ADDON_BUCKET_NAME=&lt;your bucket name&gt;
CELLAR_ADDON_ENDPOINT=https://cellar-c2.services.clever-cloud.com
</code></pre>
<p>You can now commit the local files we have changed and push them to your Clever Cloud remote to enjoy Active Storage in production.</p>
<p>Do not forget to edit your safe params in your controllers, forms and permissions.</p>
<p>Happy storing!</p>

The long-awaited <a href="https://deno.land/v1">Deno 1.0</a> release is among us. What is Deno you ask?</p>
<p><span id="more-2826"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.</p></blockquote>
<p>More Rust code is often something that makes us happy at Clever Cloud. So purely based on this, and because we like new, shiny toys, here&#39;s how to deploy a Deno application on Clever Cloud.</p>
<p>Clever Cloud being a PaaS, there are a bunch of things that can happen automatically, some that can be configured through environment variables. But Deno is not fully integrated to all our tooling yet, so instead we are going to use a NodeJS application with a twist.</p>
<p>I am going to assume you already have our CLI <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/">Clever-tools</a> installed, npm and git as well. </p>
<p>First thing first, create a git repo and a node package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git init
npm init
</code></pre>
<p>Then we install Deno. And if there is something I do not like, it&#39;s executing arbitrary shell script from the internet. So I am not going to use their installer. Deno is available as a downloadable binary from their Github Repo. It will do just fine in our case. Create a new folder for your application. From now on every file should be created in that folder.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a shell script that will manage the download and extraction of a specific Deno version:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wget https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/download/$DENO_VERSION/deno-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip
unzip deno-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.zip
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the use of <code>$DENO_VERSION</code> that will define which one will be downloaded. Let&#39;s call this file <code>installdeno.sh</code> and make it executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">chmod +x installdeno.sh
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can create the Clever Cloud application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">clever create --type node myDenoApplication
</code></pre>
<p>As I wrote earlier, we can specify custom behavior with environment variable. So let&#39;s add one that will automate the installation of Deno with our script and one to specify the version we want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">clever env set CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK ./installdeno.sh
clever env set DENO_VERSION v1.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>You can execute arbitrary scripts during the deployment of the application; here we want to execute <code>installdeno.sh</code> before the build phase. You&#39;ll find the list of hooks in our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-cloud-overview/hooks/">dedicated documentation</a>.</p>
<p>For the application itself, I took a look at the available Deno module and because I am super lazy I chose the first web framework of the list, <a href="https://github.com/zhmushan/abc">abc</a>. There is an Hello World example in the Readme, that&#39;s perfect for this test. So go ahead and create <code>abc.js</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { Application } from &quot;https://deno.land/x/abc/mod.ts&quot;;

const app = new Application();

app
  .get(&quot;/&quot;, (c) =&gt; {
    return &quot;Hello, Abc!&quot;;
  })
  .start({ port: 8080 });
</code></pre>
<p>The remaining question is, how do we launch this application? Remember that on Clever Cloud, the run process looks at your <code>package.json</code> the <code>main</code> file or <code>start</code> script to know what to execute. Let&#39;s use this to our advantage and simply add a start script that uses the Deno binary downloaded by the script.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;abc-test&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;:&quot;./deno run --allow-net abc.js&quot;,
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
  },
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The only thing left to do is to commit your code and deploy it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git add abc.js installdeno.sh package.json
clever deploy
</code></pre>
<p>From there you should see logs of your deployment showing up. The final message should be <code>Deployment successful</code>. Now type <code>clever open</code> and it will automatically open the website in your default browser.</p>
<p>Granted, this is a little raw and it could feel like cheating but it works and your app benefits from all the Clever Cloud good stuffs, just like any another application:</p>
<ul>
<li>environment variables injection</li>
<li>monitoring &amp; alerting (auto restart)</li>
<li>zero downtime deployments</li>
<li>metrics (data &amp; charts)</li>
<li>live logs</li>
<li>automatic scalability</li>
</ul>
<p>If we see a growing interest in Deno in our community we will make sure it&#39;s available with a proper, dedicated and simpler support. Let us know what you think about it and if you intend to use it!</p>

I needed to integrate a Metabase dashboard in one of my applications and I realized there is no article which explains how to do that. So, ta-da!</p>
<p><span id="more-2825"></span></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>To follow this tutorial, you will need</p>
<ul>
<li>a Metabase dashboard (read <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2019/02/20/how-to-install-metabase/">this article</a> from my fellow Laurent Dogin to have yours set up in a few minutes)</li>
<li>a Ruby on Rails application (read <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2019/05/07/setup-your-ruby-on-rails-online-dev-environment/">this article</a> by me if you need to set up one)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enabling-integration-in-metabase">Enabling integration in Metabase</h2>
<p>From your Metabase, click on the top right <strong>gear icon</strong>, then <strong>Admin</strong>. On the left menu select <strong>Embedding in other Applications</strong>. Toggle the button to have it saying <strong>Enabled</strong>. You will now get an Embedding API key. Save it for later.</p>
<figure style="position:relative;width:100%;height:auto;margin:0 auto">
  <img data-action="zoom"  alt="Enable integrations on Metabase" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/metabase-integration-screenshot.png"/><br />
</figure>
<p>Leave Metabase admin and select the dashboard you want to integrate. Click the sharing and embedding icon on the top right of your dashboard. Now select <strong>Embed this dashboard in an Application</strong>. Finally, click on the <strong>Publish</strong> button.</p>
<h2 id="integrate-metabase-in-rails">Integrate Metabase in Rails</h2>
<p>In your Gemfile, add <code>gem &#39;jwt&#39;</code> then run <code>$ bundle install</code>. If your application is deployed on Clever Cloud go to your application&#39;s console and under your application&#39;s menu go to the <strong>environment variables</strong> menu. If you deploy locally, use the <a href="https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro">gem figaro</a> and edit your application.yml. Anyway you must add two environment variables</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">METABASE_SITE_URL: &lt;your metabase url&gt;
METABASE_SECRET_KEY: &lt;the API key from metabase admin&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In the controller action where you want to integrate your metabase dashboard, add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">payload = {
          :resource =&gt; {:dashboard =&gt; &lt;your dashboard number&gt;},
          :params =&gt; { },
          :exp =&gt; Time.now.to_i + (60 * 10) # 10 minute expiration
    }
token = JWT.encode(payload, ENV[&quot;METABASE_SECRET_KEY&quot;])
@iframe_url = ENV[&quot;METABASE_SITE_URL&quot;] + &quot;/embed/dashboard/&quot; + token + &quot;#bordered=true&amp;titled=true&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now in your view, add</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;iframe
    src=&quot;&lt;%= @iframe_url %&gt;&quot;
    frameborder=&quot;0&quot;
    width=&quot;800&quot;
    height=&quot;600&quot;
    allowtransparency
&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You are all set. Just restart your application so the new environment variables are taken in consideration. Voilà, your application now has an integrated Metabase dashboard.</p>

Everything you need is now available in our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-cloud-apis/cc-api/">API</a> and <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-tools/tcp-redirections/">Clever Tools</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2974"></span></p>
<p>Before this new release of <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/">clever-tools</a> you were limited to HTTP only applications. Or you had to ask our support team to open a TCP port if you needed one. Now you can open one yourself like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ clever tcp-redirs add --namespace cleverapps
Successfully added tcp redirection on port: 21562
</code></pre>
<p>What happened here is we changed the configuration of all the cleverapps.io proxies to forward every incoming request from yourapp.cleverapps.io:21562 to the port 4040 of the VM that runs your app. The <code>--namespace</code> option is here to tell us on which proxy we need to update the configuration. The <code>cleverapps</code> namespace is used for the cleverapps.io domain. The <code>default</code> namespace is used for all your custom domains. If you have your own set of proxies, you will also have a custom namespace. You can get the list of available domains with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ clever tcp-redirs list-namespaces
Available namespaces: default, cleverapps
</code></pre>
<p>You will find more details about it on our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-tools/tcp-redirections/">dedicated documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this feature is still in Beta, as such it is currently free, but will be billed once we get out of Beta.</p>
<p>To make sure everything works as it should, your application has to listen to port 4040 for TCP and the usual 8080 for HTTP. We still run health check of your applications on port 8080 so you still need an HTTP server.</p>
<p>This opens a door to new possibilities like deploying MQTT servers, LDAP directories, or this quick TCP chat that my colleague Hubert wrote: <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/tcp-chat">https://github.com/CleverCloud/tcp-chat</a></p>
<p>Let&#39;s try this out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone https://github.com/CleverCloud/tcp-chat
$ cd tcp-chat
$ clever create --type node tcp-chat
$ clever tcp-redirs add --namespace cleverapps
$ Successfully added tcp redirection on port: 21562
$ clever domain add mychat.cleverapps.io
$ telnet mychat.cleverapps.io 21562
</code></pre>
<p>And now you are in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">telnet</a> session chatting with whoever join that telnet session as well. Are you aware that vi and telnet have one thing in common? No one remembers how to quit(type <code>]</code> then <code>exit</code>).</p>
<p>Please let us know what you want to deploy thanks to this new feature.</p>

There are numerous tools to help you do that, but one particularly caught my attention as it is also destined to developers first.<span id="more-2824"></span> <a href="https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck">MDX-deck</a> allows you to write <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> components and content in <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> among other cool stuffs. Check out the official repo to find out more about the capabilities of the project.</p>
<p>Wether you&#39;re doing presentations or not, read carefully, we are about to deploy a static application made out of a React build and use the Clever Cloud hooks to do so. Ready? Let&#39;s go.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>you need to have <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm">npm</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">git</a> installed on your machine.</li>
<li>you need a <a href="https://api.clever-cloud.com/v2/sessions/signup">Clever Cloud account</a> with at least a validated email to benefit the free credits.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setting-up-our-mdx-deck">Setting up our MDX-Deck</h3>
<p>Go to your console and type in</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mkdir presentation //creating a new folder
$ cd presentation
$ git init // creating fresh git folder
$ npm init //creating new project
</code></pre>
<p>Just type enter for eveything you&#39;re prompted of except for <code>description</code> if you would like to provide one, <code>author</code> that you must fill, <code>license</code> that you can edit to the licence you want your project to be under.</p>
<p>Now we will create our presentation file with <code>$ touch deck.mdx</code> and add the package to the project with <code>$ npm i -D mdx-deck</code>.</p>
<p>Open the project in your text editor and start with fine tuning <code>package.json</code> Here we want to remove the line</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
</code></pre>
<p>and add a start and a build command using the mxd-deck CLI with the file we just created to our scripts</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;mdx-deck deck.mdx&quot;,
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;mdx-deck build deck.mdx&quot;,
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;echo \&quot;Error: no test specified\&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1&quot;
},
</code></pre>
<p>We will only use <code>start</code> to test locally and use <code>build</code> to deploy. We are done with <code>package.json</code>, we can now move to <code>deck.mdx</code>. Add this in the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Congratulations!

---

## You&#39;re up and live on Clever Cloud!

---
</code></pre>
<p>You can note that we have just created two slides, each one ending with <code>---</code> and that we are using the Markdown syntax. Let&#39;s see how it renders with <code>npm start</code>. Your browser will open at <code>http://localhost:8000</code> displaying our first slide. Use side arrows to navigate between pages.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-to-clever-cloud-as-static-with-hooks">Deploy to clever cloud as static with hooks</h2>
<p>Now we will create a static application in the <a href="https://console.clever-cloud.com/">Clever Cloud console</a>. Under the organization of our choice, we will click the <strong>Create</strong> button and select <strong>application</strong>, then <strong>Static</strong>. Follow the instructions, and just select <strong>git</strong> when you have the choice between it and FTP. A git remote will be provided to you. Add it to your local repository with the provided command and get back to the Clever Cloud console. Select <strong>Environment variables</strong> in the left menu of your application and add <code>CC_PRE_RUN_HOOK</code> with value <code>npm run build</code> and <code>CC_WEBROOT</code> with value <code>/public</code>. Do not forget to add each new variable and to update changes when you are done editing.</p>
<p>Now we can push our sources to the clever git remote we set previously by adding and committing them, then pushing with <code>$ git push clever master</code>. It is also possible to du it using the Clever Cloud CLI with <code>clever deploy</code>. Documentation <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-tools/getting_started/">here</a></p>
<p>In the Clever Cloud console, the deployment logs will appear and after a little you will be able to navigate to your application by going to the <strong>overview</strong> page of your application and clicking the link icon on the top right. Use right arrow to navigate to slide two. But what did just happen?</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>The <code>CC_PRE_RUN_HOOK</code> is a command run only if specified. This hook is run before the dependencies are fetched and has the specificity to make your deployment fail if it no successful. This is helpful as we do not want to try running a failed build result and have confusing errors harder to debug.<br />
 Here, we gave it the value of <code>npm run-script build</code>, this basically tells npm to run our build command specified in <code>package.json</code>. Build command which runs mdx-deck build cli. That leaves us with a new <code>/public</code> folder containing our website static web pages. The other environment variable we used is <code>CC_WEBROOT</code>. This variable tells the server to set the DocumentRoot to the  <code>/public</code> folder wich contains your web pages. This is where a visitor will end up when visiting your website.</p>
<p>You can, of course adapt, it to any other npm project static build.</p>

Throughout the years, while building apps, Clément was always searching for beautiful icons. Then he founds Vincent’s (<a href="(https://twitter.com/webalys)">@webalys</a>, a French designer based in Massachusetts, USA) work: the Streamline Icons project (<a href="https://streamlineicons.com">streamlineicons.com</a>) in the late 2014.</p>
<p><span id="more-2773"></span></p>
<p>Nowadays Clément is primarily focused on 2 projects, <strong>Just a Call</strong> (<a href="https://justacall.io">justacall.io</a>), a contact center in Slack and The Streamline App, an app with all <strong>Webalys</strong>’s icons (more than 30,000 icons available, and more to come).</p>
<p>There are a bunch of different websites where can find icons in the wild, but you’ll find disparate styles: glyphs, outlines … Then you will have to open your favorite design software (Illustrator, Sketch, …) to swap colors, size, export,  etc.</p>
<p>The Streamline app is different, they use web technologies to make a fast, reliable and responsive platform. Customers can access their beloved icon collections from all over the world, changing color live, and exporting them in different formats (PNG, SVG, PDF). They’ve also published React packages, developers can have access to beautifully created icons just by typing <code>&lt;StreamlineIcon /&gt;</code> in their favorite IDE.</p>
<p>Clément started to develop a viewer a year and a half ago, the initial idea was to expose the whole collections to Vincent’s customers (including fortune 500 like <a href="http://booking.com/">Booking.com</a>, Mercedes-Benz, Converse, Bank of America…), see what icons were available before buying and downloading the pack.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the application is much more complex: Mainly javascript (Node runtime in the back, React front end), with a bit of Python (ML with Tensorflow) and Elixir (locally).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We had to build something super robust because it must not crash with customers; everything is tested, very solid, this is one of the reasons why we use Clever Cloud.”</p>

<h3 id="separated-work-better-concerns">Separated work, better concerns</h3>
<p>I’m not an infra guy; I’m a “<strong>creative</strong>”, trying to change the world with my text editor (paraphrasing <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffiel">Jeff Lawson</a>, Twilio co-founder &amp; CEO). I need to create <strong>content</strong> without worrying about <strong>infrastructure</strong>. I want to use code to make, not something else.</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-confidence">Performance and Confidence</h3>
<p>Being a freelancer, sometimes, I have to use other hosting providers to fit my customer&#39;s requirements (the same provider, their own solutions…). Throughout 2019, my Clever Cloud hosted apps were down for 8 minutes, while at Ionos (formely 1 &amp; 1) they were down over 5 or 6 days.</p>
<h3 id="costs-reasons">Costs Reasons</h3>
<p>Clever Cloud has the right pricing. It is much more advantageous than another huge player based in Seattle, WA, USA, for example, at the end of the month you don’t end up with a crazy bill and bad surprises. Just an example here : Yesterday, one of my app had to handle 1,4 Millions requests (that&#39;s 40% more than usually), the cost for me was just&#8230; 24 cents.</p>
<h3 id="friendship-and-innovation">Friendship and Innovation</h3>
<p>I know Quentin for years now (and Clément for a little bit less), I trust them and I know they are 200% committed to their company. Trying to build yet the best hosting provider with a great focus on customer care and innovation which are truly important these days.</p>
<p>PS: Clément is the developer behind <strong>Clever Companion</strong> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/clever-companion/id1454703865">https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/clever-companion/id1454703865</a>) the official Clever Client for macOS.</p>

<p>Access logs contain all incoming requests to a web server. They are available in different formats. One of the most common being CLF which stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format">Common Log Format</a>. Here&#39;s an example where you can find the IP of the client, date, HTTP verb, URL target, status code and size of the answer: <code>255.255.255.255 - - [06/Feb/2020:07:59:22 +0100] &quot;GET /aget/to/your/beautiful/website -&quot; 200 1453</code></p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-your-access-logs">How to get your access logs</h2>
<p>To get your access logs you need to use <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools/">clever-tools</a> and run this in a linked application:</p>
<p><code>clever accesslogs</code></p>
<p>You will get all the requests that came to this app in the last hour. This also work for most dedicated add-ons using <code>--addon</code> followed by the add-on id:</p>
<p><code>clever accesslogs --addon addon_41c5a60f-11c6-442a-9803-f4604fe8638b</code></p>
<p>You can also choose a date span using <code>--after</code> and <code>--before</code> like so:</p>
<p><code>clever accesslogs --after 2020-03-27 --before 2020-03-29</code></p>
<p>Any date you give must follow ISO 8601. You could for instance have a microsecond precision like this:</p>
<p><code>clever accesslogs --after 2020-03-29T11:01:02.120000Z --before 2020-03-29T11:01:02.123456Z</code></p>
<p>You can also change the format of the logs with <code>-F</code> (or <code>--format</code>):</p>
<p><code>clever accesslogs --after 2020-03-28 --before 2020-03-29 -F json</code></p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of JSON entry, it contains all of the information currently available for each request:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;t&quot;: &quot;2020-03-10T11:24:34.220324Z&quot;,

    &quot;ct&quot;: &quot;Cachan&quot;,
    &quot;co&quot;: &quot;FR&quot;
  },
  &quot;vb&quot;: &quot;GET&quot;,
  &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/status-codes/500&quot;,
  &quot;bIn&quot;: 411,
  &quot;bOut&quot;: 443,

  &quot;tlsV&quot;: &quot;TLS1.3&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You will find the details for every field in our <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/administrate/metrics/overview/#access-logs-metrics">access logs documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-your-logs">What you can do with your logs</h2>
<p>Now let&#39;s say you want to know what are the most returned status codes from a log file, here&#39;s how you can do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">clever accesslogs --after 2020-03-10 --before 2020-03-20 -F json | jq .sC | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
</code></pre>
<p>Here we use the JSON format and <code>jq</code> to select the field we want, then <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> to get a proper output, which would yield something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">  99999 200
     56 500
     33 404
      2 400
      1 403
      1 301
      1 202
</code></pre>
<p>The first column being the number of hits and the second being the status code.</p>
<p>Now for something a bit more practical, here&#39;s a script that allows you to split access logs for each day between two dates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

input_start=2020-01-01
input_end=2020-03-27

startdate=$(date -I -d &quot;$input_start&quot;) || exit -1
enddate=$(date -I -d &quot;$input_end&quot;)     || exit -1

d=&quot;$startdate&quot;
while [ &quot;$d&quot; != &quot;$enddate&quot; ]; do
  clever accesslogs --alias prod --after $d --before $(date -I -d &quot;$bv d + 1 day&quot;) -F clf &gt; access-$d.out
  d=$(date -I -d &quot;$d + 1 day&quot;)
done
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s hard to visualize so much data if you don&#39;t have the proper tools. So I really invite you to try <a href="https://goaccess.io/">GoAccess</a>. Combine the script above and this command <code>goaccess access* -o report.html --log-format=COMMON --anonymize-ip</code>. You will get this neat, anonymized HTML report:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="Demonstrating the filter"  src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/goaccess.png"/><figcaption>Viusalize CLF logs with GoAccess</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are of course lots of other tools you can use to visualize logs, like our latest <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/elastic/">Elastic add-on</a> for instance 🙂 Or you can go straight into the metrics tab of your application or add-on and start playing with Warp10. This is actually what we use when you see the live map under the Overview tab of your application.</p>
<p>We hope you&#39;ll find this new feature practical and as always welcome your input to make this better. Happy coding!</p>

Technology can be a real strength, a time-saver, a life facilitator, particularly in the medical sector.</p>
<p><span id="more-2772"></span></p>
<p>Founded eight years ago, <a href="https://www.ubilab.io/">Ubilab</a> is a software range for medical testing laboratories. This ergonomic solution groups together all the tools that laboratories will need for internal communication towards healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Ubilab has two essential products: Ubilab Home and Ubilab Result. Ubilab Home is for professionals, and Ubilab Result is for patients. These products are mainly technological: software in saas, web, and mobile access, company filled with developers directly from the Scala world.</p>
<p><center><strong>104 210 users &#038; 1879 Laboratories</strong></center></p>
<h2 id="meeting-with-guillaume-badin-cto-at-ubilab">Meeting with Guillaume Badin, CTO at Ubilab</h2>
<p>Tech has an essential place in our company; our product is technological. My job is to code, not to manage servers, that’s why the offer of Clever Cloud meets our needs. This year we will launch Ubilab results and visit, and we need to accelerate the deployment of these products in laboratories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As a CTO, my role is to foster interaction between developers, internal communication, and allow the team as a whole to be more efficient.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My team is organized around poles; we have a front pole and a back pole, we organize around tasks performed, our objectives are to deploy new functionalities rapidly. The idea is that we test it every time, and it goes into production. My challenge is to develop tools to make the whole team go faster and to help developers grow daily.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-you-hear-about-clever-cloud">How did you hear about Clever Cloud</h2>
<p>I discovered Clever Cloud via the Scala world, at a Scala IO conference. I had the opportunity to eat next to Quentin Adam, we discussed my issues, and it made me want to test your platform.</p>
<p>Before we were with Rackspace, we had to manage our servers ourselves; it was time-consuming, the updates were complicated; there was no security update. The idea of ​​pushing its code and making it easy to deploy won us over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Being able to push and test quickly allows us to implement new features more regularly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we are at Clever Cloud, the deployment works very well. We like the culture of Clever Cloud, which brings a lot to the community. Support helps us when we need it. Clever Cloud has changed the way we work; we are now doing pre-production which makes us gain in quality.</p>
<h2 id="what-changes-with-clever-cloud-">What changes with Clever Cloud ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Push into production every day</li>
<li>DevOps time reduces by 95%</li>
<li>2-3 hours earned per week</li>
<li>A lot of serenity</li>
</ul>

To do so I already had meetup data indexed in my Elastic instance. Today I am going to tell you how I did gather data and added it to Elasticsearch.</p>
<p><span id="more-2972"></span></p>
<h2 id="selecting-meetups-i-want-to-track">Selecting meetups I want to track</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is to select a list of meetup groups you want to keep track of. There are many ways to do that using the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/">Meetup API</a>. For instance, you can search to similar groups using the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/meetup_api/docs/:urlname/similar_groups/?uri=%2Fmeetup_api%2Fdocs%2F%3Aurlname%2Fsimilar_groups%2F">similar_groups endpoint</a>. I let you read the API documentation to find a way to select the events you will track. You just need to format the response to extract the cities and the names of the Meetups groups in a JSON file formatted as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;City name 1&quot;: [
    &quot;meetup group name 1&quot;,
    &quot;meetup group name 2&quot;,
    ...
  ],
  &quot;City name 2&quot;: [
    &quot;meetup group name 1&quot;,
    ...
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="getting-data-about-meetup-events">Getting data about meetup events</h2>
<p>Once you have this, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/CleverCloud/meetups-elastic-import">node.js application we created</a>. Of course it has the Elasticsearch dependency in package.json. You are strongly invited to check out the source code at this point. You can see in the index.js many parts of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creation of an express server listening on port 8080. We need it, so Clever Cloud will know our app is up running.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&gt; {
    res.send(&#39;Hello !&#39;);
});
app.listen(8080, () =&gt; console.log(&#39;Listening on port 8080!&#39;));
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The meetup API call:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">axios.get(`https://api.meetup.com/${meetupName}/events/?status=past,upcoming\&amp;fields=comment_count`)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>the creation of Elasticsearch indexes:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">await client.indices.create({
  index: &quot;meetup&quot;,
  body : {
    &quot;mappings&quot;: {
      &quot;properties&quot;: {
        &quot;time&quot;:  {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;date&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;epoch_millis&quot;},
        &quot;group.name&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;keyword&quot;},
        &quot;yes_rsvp_count&quot; : {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;},
        &quot;grouploc&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;geo_point&quot;},
        &quot;venueloc&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;: &quot;geo_point&quot;}
      }
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The creation of another server where our meetup API calls happen, listening on port 8081. We can also notice that we&#39;ve restricted our server to allow only localhost connections.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">localapp.listen(8081, &#39;localhost&#39;, function() {
  console.log(&quot;... port %d in %s mode&quot;, 8081, localapp.settings.env);
</code></pre>
<p>Now in <code>./clevercloud/cron.json</code> you can notice a cron task, wich will trigger a curl on <code>http://localhost:8081/</code> every night at 1 AM:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;0 1 * * * /usr/host/bin/curl http://localhost:8081/&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It is this cron that will call our second server to trigger the meetup API calls.</p>
<p>True fact: to use it in its current version, you must keep your application running all the time for one hour of usage maximum. A way to improve the application regarding this issue would be to implement authentication to our application, so we still are the only one having access.</p>
<p>Then remove the cron from this project to have it running in your main application instead. Your main application will be the one consuming this indexed data. Taking advantage on the fact that every virtual machine running on Clever Cloud already has the Clever Tools CLI installed, we could improve our cron to start the application for an hour then stop it when it has finished its indexation job.</p>
<p>So you will end up with two machines, one with your main application, and the second one running for one hour each night.</p>
<p>We must also know that Clever Cloud does not monitor what&#39;s going on on port 8081. You could add a logging system or use Elastic APM to monitor your application during its execution time.</p>
<p>This is an approach among many others, do not hesitate to talk with us about your own implementation.</p>
<p>Okay, let&#39;s go back to our main goal, and to do so, you can use our sample data meetup list or use your own by replacing the json in the <code>meetups.json</code>file.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>
<p>You can <code>$ git clone</code> the repo in your console, and go into your Clever Cloud console.</p>
<p>Under the organization of your choice, select <strong>New</strong>, <strong>Application</strong>, <strong>Node</strong>. When prompted if you need add-ons, select <strong>Elastic Stack</strong>, select the plan you need and <strong>enable Kibana</strong> as an option.</p>
<p>In the environment variables menu of your application, add <code>NODE_ENV=production</code> and add the provided <code>clever remote</code> to your local git folder. Then push using <code>git push -u clever master</code>.</p>
<p>Your deployment will start and thanks to the <code>ES_ADDON_URI</code> we provided in our index.js file, we have nothing else to configure, our application will start sending data to elastic.</p>
<h2 id="visualize-your-data-and-go-further">Visualize your data and go further</h2>
<p>Either in your Kibana or Elastic instance menu in the Clever Cloud console, in the information page you will find a <strong>Open Kibana</strong> button. Click it and login using your Clever Cloud credentials.</p>
<p>Into Kibana click on the <strong>Management</strong> (gear) icon in the left side menu. Under the Kibana title, select <strong>Index Patterns</strong>, then <strong>meetup*</strong> to see how the data is indexed.</p>
<figure style="position:relative;width:50%;height:auto;margin:0 auto">
  <img data-action="zoom"  alt="index of meetups in Kibana" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/kibana-meetups.png"/><br />
</figure>
<p>Of course at this point, you are able to do the exact same as I did in the previous article <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/e36ce43a8d104984bba96cde3c67d714">video</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the ElasticSQL query I used in the Canvas demonstration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT AVG(&quot;yes_rsvp_count&quot;) AS average, &quot;group.name&quot; FROM &quot;meetup*&quot;
GROUP BY &quot;group.name&quot;
ORDER BY average DESC
LIMIT 5

You will love Canvas</h2>
<p>Canvas is a feature that comes inside our beloved Kibana dashboard and allows us to visualize and present our data from our Elasticsearch <em>our</em> way.</p>
<p><span id="more-2971"></span></p>
<p>Whether you are working with application metrics, security events, infrastructure logs, business-related data or even your side projects, as long as you put the generated info in an Elasticsearch instance, you will be able to display them in an elegant way.</p>
<p>Create workpads with combined data from your Elasticsearch and convert them into beautiful charts, graphs, progress monitors, infographics, reports… The only limit is your imagination (yes, for real)!</p>
<p>You already have a visual identity ? Import your logo, your color schemes, your css to get a consistent interface all over and reuse them everywhere! Share them with your users and customers with ease so your branding is really homogeneous.</p>
<p>Not having a visual identity? There are tons of color palettes and templates you can play around with.</p>
<p>Make your workpads dynamic using time-series data, add your Elastic Maps into your workpads, choose how often it should be updated.</p>
<p>Canvas also lets you customize your workspace with backgrounds, colors, fonts, images and more.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-easy-to-use">Is it easy to use</h2>
<p>What a question! You should know how simple is the Elastic Stack experience!</p>
<p>Canvas arrives out of the box inside Kibana on Clever Cloud, with features like syntax highlighting, mouse-over context-sensitive help, drag and drop publishing, dark mode and more to help you create pixel-perfect visuals with your data.</p>
<p>Use Elasticsearch SQL to design aggregations like you already do in your applications and display them in your workpads.</p>
<p>Canvas comes with its own library of functions to empower your imagination but if it’s not enough, with the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/7.6/intro.html">Elastic plugin framework</a>, you can also add your own plugins or community ones no matter how experienced in development you are.</p>
<p>And thanks to Clever Cloud, keeping everything in operating condition is pretty simple, as we manage this for you. While as usual providing you a Europe-based infrastructure, GDPR compliant and protected from Cloud Act.</p>
<h2 id="reuse-your-workpads-everywhere">Reuse your workpads everywhere</h2>
<p>You might wonder: what can I do with my awesome creations? Well, actually almost everything!</p>
<p>You can, of course, use them in your Kibana, but here are some examples of usage you can have outside of your dashboards:</p>
<ul>
<li>export your workpads as JSON</li>
<li>generate one shot PDF</li>
<li>automate PDF reporting with a POST endpoint</li>
<li>display your workpads on websites (and customize them there to match the design of the page)</li>
<li>get live reporting on screens in your office, retail points or any place</li>
<li>add real data to your weekly, monthly … emails</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, the only limit is your imagination! </p>

When we say APM in the IT context, we refer to solutions that monitor the platform hosting the application and the app itself.</p>
<p>APM solutions extract information and data about processes, memory usage, disk reading or writing operations/seconds, and other information about the hosting platform.<span id="more-2970"></span> On the application side, they monitor in and out requests, errors, issues, and even code execution to highlight memory and time consuming processes.</p>
<p>These tools can be very important when you are on a cloud based service that auto scales, because some of these issues may be hidden by the auto allocation of more resources to an application. They also give the opportunity to check if the cloud provider&#39;s SLA is honored.</p>
<h2 id="apm-by-elastic">APM by Elastic</h2>
<p>Available since version 6.2 (released in 2018), <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/apm">Elastic APM</a> has proven its efficiency on monitoring and improving applications. Elastic APM monitors in real-time memory allocations, bandwidth usage, data rates, response time, database queries, CPU resources on the client side, calls to cache, unhandled errors and exceptions with their stack trace, aggregates logs in a pretty format and much more thanks to client and server side APM agents.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing feature allows you to see how a request flows into your micro-services architecture and to identify what exactly needs to be improved.</p>
<p>As all the collected data are stored and indexed in Elasticsearch, it&#39;s very easy to query them and point out bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Additionally, data is automatically available to consultation in a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/kibana">Kibana</a> dashboard. This dashboard comes with a special UI from Elastic where you can conveniently explore your data via generated charts, see metrics about CPU and system memory usage, get the best out of their default filtering by request type, request results, errors with the already identified culprit. And of course you can investigate by search, all of this working out of the box.</p>
<p>And as if it was not enough to really improve our &quot;coding, debugging and releasing&quot; workflows, Elastic APM can send email alerts or Slack notifications when issues arise.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, APM needs an instance of Elasticsearch, an APM server, Kibana and an agent on the application side. On Clever Cloud, all you need to do is to configure your application to use the agent. Let&#39;s see how to do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blte9da1a8d579819a3/5dcb10f1257ee801fd16d1ab/screenshot-kibana-apm-os-dashboard.jpg" alt="APM dashboard in kibana"></p>
<h2 id="elastic-apm-on-clever-cloud">Elastic APM on Clever Cloud</h2>
<p>If you have read other blog posts of mine, you may know that I&#39;m a Ruby on Rails lover, so no surprise if I chose this Framework to demonstrate how easy it is to get started with the Elastic APM on Clever Cloud. However, APM Agents are available in many languages, so you can follow this tutorial and replace the Ruby on Rails application by one of yours hosted on Clever Cloud that is written in one of the following languages: Go, Java, JavaScript (backend or frontend) or Python.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-rails-application">Creating the Rails application</h3>
<p>Well, I&#39;m not really a person that likes to do the same thing twice so as I already wrote an article on how to deploy Ruby on Rails applications on Clever Cloud, I will start this tutorial by considering you already have an application running like at the end of my previous article. If you don&#39;t, do not hesitate to take a break to follow <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/engineering/2019/05/07/setup-your-ruby-on-rails-online-dev-environment/">the tutorial</a>, it takes five minutes to be all set.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-es-stack-on-clever-cloud">Creating the ES stack on Clever Cloud</h3>
<p>Well, it&#39;s pretty easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your Clever Cloud console, under the organization where your application lives, select <strong>Create</strong> then <strong>an add-on</strong>. Scroll down until you find and select <strong>Elastic Stack</strong>.</li>
<li>On the next screen select the plan you need, there is no minimal size to benefit from these features.</li>
<li>On the next screen enable APM and Kibana</li>
<li>You will now be prompted to name your add-on, and you will be able to select the deployment region. Fine tune as you need and press <strong>next</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Service dependencies</strong> section of your application, then select the APM server in the <strong>Link applications</strong> drop down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Elastic Stack add-on will be automatically created: Elasticsearch, an APM server and a Kibana instance will start. You will see them appear shortly under your organization; there&#39;s nothing more you need to do to start using them.</p>
<p>If you navigate to your application&#39;s <strong>Environment variables</strong> menu, you will see that you can now use environment variables provided by the add-on we just created. And fortunately this is almost everything we need to finish this configuration.</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> Make sure that you linked the <ins>APM server</ins>, and not the Elastic add-on. Otherwise, you won&#39;t have the correct ENV VAR for the next steps.</p>
<h3 id="configure-your-application-for-apm">Configure your Application for APM</h3>
<h4 id="ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails</h4>
<p>Go in your terminal, under your application repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>with your favorite text editor, edit the <code>Gemfile</code> to add <code>gem &#39;elastic-apm&#39;</code>.</li>
<li>Create a file named <code>config/elastic_apm.yml</code> that you will fill with this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">server_url: &lt;%= ENV[&quot;ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URLS&quot;] %&gt;
secret_token: &lt;%= ENV[&quot;ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN&quot;] %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You may here notice the usage of environment variables to protect APM server&#39;s secrets. You can use these environment variables thanks to linking your application to your APM server on Clever Cloud.</p>
<h4 id="other-languages">Other languages</h4>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/index.html">here</a> the list of all the APM agents by language. You can just follow the simple steps and refer to the environment variables mentioned in the Ruby on Rails section to replace host url and secret token values. You may also need to use additional environment variables, read <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/admin-console/environment-variables/">this</a> to add them to your Clever Cloud application.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-the-apm-agent">Deploying the APM agent</h3>
<p>Okay, that was it. Now, you can add, commit and push these changes to Clever Cloud either via the CLI <code>clever deploy</code> or by pushing on the Clever Cloud git remote (usually named <code>clever</code>) of your application using <code>git push clever master</code>. Your application will restart within seconds and instantly connect to the APM server thanks to the environment variables we provided.</p>
<h3 id="enjoying-your-apm--kibana">Enjoying your APM / Kibana</h3>
<p>Now that our application is restarted, we can go to our Kibana application in Clever Cloud and click the link icon at the top right of the application menus. This will open a new tab with a Clever Cloud login form. Connect with your Clever Cloud credentials. This will open your Kibana after a brief apparition of a Keycloak page.</p>
<p>As Keycloak is not the topic here, all I&#39;ll say is that authentication to Kibana is delegated to Clever Cloud using this solution. If you want to know more about it, <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/elastic/#kibana">read this</a>.</p>
<p>In Kibana, find the APM section in the menu on the left (tip: you can unroll the menu with a button at the bottom of the menu). Click it and <em>Wow!</em> you already can visualize your first application performance metrics in the beautiful Elastic UI for Kibana.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a step by step video:</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 50.79962370649106%; height: 0;">
  <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/af70aab3a26a41ac88cdb8094fd64862" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>
</div>
<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>
<p>What we&#39;ve done so far is pretty great as we can now monitor our applications performances in real time and we needed to setup almost nothing. This is <em>way</em> better than having nothing, but if you&#39;re familiar with APM tools you may want to customize and/or add more data to your reportings.</p>
<p>You can read the configuration section of each agent to get the best out of the configuration file we created. You will be able to extend the APM server side agent&#39;s configuration like adding your own tags and key filters, decide what exactly you want to capture for each request to your server, fine tune the way the data is sent to the APM server including size and time of the requests and much more. You can learn more about the data model of the events captured by APM <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/apm-data-model.html">here</a>. You are going to learn here how to enrich your events with metadata to really customize your data. If your application is client side, you can enable the RUM (Real User Monitoring) by starting <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/rum.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy monitoring!</p>

<p>Our starting price is 17 euros per month. With this you can get the full extent of the Elastic Stack, at a very small scale. On the other hand, you can go all the way up to 64 CPUs and 256Go of RAM per node. Our support team will manage the first levels of support while being able to escalate to Elastic&#39;s team when needed. You are in good hands!</p>
<p>And of course we worked on an integration with the rest of Clever Cloud. Please have a look at <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/addons/elastic/">our documentation</a> for the details. Here&#39;s a quick glance at what we did.</p>
<h2 id="specific-clever-cloud-integrations">Specific Clever Cloud Integrations</h2>
<p>We have worked on our Elastic Stack integration on several fronts. When you provision the Elastic add-on, we allow you to provision Kibana and an APM server as traditional Clever Cloud applications. It means that they benefit from all the goodness that we bring to applications. You can turn them off if you want to, you can enable auto scalability, you can link them to other applications, really anything you would do with traditional applications. Let&#39;s see each integration a bit more in details.</p>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>Authenticating to Kibana is available through an automatically configured SSO. Every member of the organisation the addon has been deployed to can use their Clever Cloud account to authenticate. No configuration is required on your part.</p>
<h3 id="elastic-apm">Elastic APM</h3>
<p>If you link the APM server application to any of your application, the right environment variables will be injected and automatically picked by the APM agent in your dependencies. Then simply authenticate to Kibana and start setting up your APM! This feature will be showcased in a dedicated blog post in the coming days.</p>

  <img alt="The ELK dashboard on Clever Cloud" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/elk-stack.png"/><br />
</figure>
<h3 id="backups">Backups</h3>
<p>We are introducing a new way to manage your add-on backups. When we create your new add-on, we also create a Cellar add-on (our S3-compatible object storage solution) named <em>Backups</em>. All your backups will be stored there. We are starting with Elasticsearch but other databases will soon follow.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next?</h2>
<p>We plan to provide an even better integration with the Elastic Stack. We are currently thinking about the best way to integrate Beats to our applications. You can currently do it manually but wouldn&#39;t it be nice if this was automated? This should really ease the usage of Elastic SIEM for instance.</p>
<p>And of course we are working on automatic cluster provisioning, not just for Elastic. In the meantime you can provision as many nodes as you need and contact our support team to put them in the same cluster.</p>
<p>We are supper excited about working with Elastic and hope you will be as excited to try it on Clever Cloud! We will publish more blog posts in the coming days, highlighting some of the awesome capabilities of our Elastic Stack integration.</p>

<p><span id="more-2770"></span></p>
<p>Good news everyone, a new Clever Cloud zone is opening in the USA! BSO Network is now a Clever Cloud on-premises customer. And has such allows us to become one of their resellers and bring you this new New-york based zone which will be available mid-march 2020.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Clever Cloud, we made a Platform as a Service available on public or private cloud and on-premises. You write code and we run it, no YAML involved, just a git push away from production. From there you get native support for most languages, Let&#39;s Encrypt integration, automatic scaling, monitoring, log collection, blue/green deployment, basically everything you need for production. And did I mention we are the one on call, not you 🙂</p>
<p>As it works on premises it can be installed anywhere. And this time it’s installed on BSO Network datacenter in new york.</p>
<h2 id="which-infrastructure-does-it-use">Which Infrastructure does it use?</h2>
<p>This infrastructure is within the Equinix NY4 Data Center, built with 2013 PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 certified. There are more than 500 customers doing business within this 103,630 square meters facility, which houses infrastructure for major financial exchanges.</p>
<p><center></p>
<figure>
    <img alt="Equinix NY4 Datacenter" style="max-width:550px" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/NY4.jpg"/><figcaption>Equinix NY4 Datacenter<figcaption>
  </figure>
<p></center></p>
<p>The infrastructure is accessible through X POPS in North America, 10 DC in New Jersey and NYC area. The cloud Platform provides  high availability with high-performance SLAs and is build for scale. BSO and Clever cloud also plan a West Region extension in order to add compute and geographic resiliency.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-act-vs-gdpr">Cloud Act vs. GDPR</h2>
<p>Our worldwide, global industry is more and more regulated and several countries came up with new laws. In our case, we need to talk about the American Cloud Act and the European GDPR. Clever Cloud being a European company, we are de facto GDPR compliant. And as the GDPR is a contaminative law we need to apply GDPR to all our customers, even non-European ones, which means we are de facto, not Cloud Act compliant</p>
<p>But fear not, Clever Cloud is first and foremost a Software Vendor and as such can be resold by a Cloud act compliant company like our partner BSO Network.</p>
<p>The way we&#39;ve engineered this partnership will allow you to use Clever Cloud in the US without issues. Here&#39;s why. A communication or cloud provider may fall under the cloud act if:</p>
<ul>
<li>HQ of the company is in the US</li>
<li>One of the branches is in the US</li>
<li>A service offer is in the US for as long as the organization exists</li>
</ul>
<p>As none of the above is true for our company, Clever Cloud won&#39;t fall under the Cloud Act law. BSO Network is operating the data center and rely on our software to manage the NYC zone with our on-premises platform. This way allows the US zone to have the full set of Clever Cloud functionalities, with multi-zones deployment made possible.</p>
<p>Customers using the NYC zone will be customers of BSO Network (buying them infrastructure and access cost to Clever Cloud Platform, the software) resell by Clever Cloud (here it’s more acting as a marketplace), and we will make Terms and Conditions changes in the next days to reflect that. From a practical standpoint, it will be transparent for our users. This also means that everything hosted on the NYC zone is compliant to the cloud act and not to the GDPR nor protected by the GDPR.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-use-it">Can I use it?</h2>
<p>If you are interested in the NY zone, please fill out the form below to get in touch! We will come back to you with the exact date and pricing for all our services.</p>
<p><strong>To get your invite to the NYC zone, please fill this form:</strong></p>

<h2 id="companies-we-are-talking-about">Companies we are talking about</h2>

<p>They had to find a solution and help future buyers. And then comes the idea of a chatbot in messenger. Thanks to this simple feature, first users were able to enter their criteria: budget, location, number of rooms, etc. Then they receive in real-time tailor-made suggestions. As in every good startup story, the beginning is not that simple. Behind this chatbot on messenger was hidden founders, doing everything by manually, without any automation, picking the right data via Google searches.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-of-manually-scrapping">The end of Manually Scrapping</h2>
<p>Then came the time to hire a real tech expert, Julien Pouillard, actual CTO at <a href="https://www.folhomee.fr/">Folhomee</a>. When Julien arrived two years ago, he had to automate the entire process. The first things were to implement a database to record every data correctly. Secondly, to develop a search system to pick data and criteria from each advertisement on properties websites. Lastly, Julien had to set up the matching between user needs and on-line ads to create a real virtual property hunter. They use machine learning to favor easy user matching, widening the selection with optional criteria. Now they can analyze vast volumes of data, and use it to extend the matching with variables.</p>
<p><center>**150 000 Users • 11 workers in auto finance**</center></p>
<p>Since Julien joined Folhomee, the company use Clever Cloud as a hosting provider. After having tested several alternatives like Heroku and AWS, Julien heard about Clever Cloud. For many years, he uses Clever Cloud for professional projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For me, Clever Cloud is the simplest, fastest, and the most efficient platform for Startups.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folhomee uses Clever Cloud to run their apps, to see metrics and logs, for their Databases with MongoDB or Redis for all the add-on part. They have several instances per app: it&#39;s interesting to see the log overlapping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s easy to contact the support; I can reach them anytime, and it always went well!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julien is the only one who handles the infrastructure part, and recently another collaborator; Maxime Amore, student apprentice, has deployed another application and a database on it:</p>
<p><em>“For Maxime first use of the platform, I gave him access to the entire Folhomee infrastructure. He could discover logs and carry out maintenance on the applications. Then when we needed a new instance, he was in charge of creating the app and the database. This initation was swift and easy.”</em></p>
<p>Now Maxime is using Clever Cloud for personal projects and master Clever Cloud platform.</p>
<h2 id="julien-how-would-you-pitch-clever-cloud">Julien, how would you pitch Clever Cloud?</h2>
<p>Clever Cloud is the application deployment platform that allows for continuous deployment with the implementation of databases or other add-on.</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Julien, for your time and much success to Folhomee!</em></p>

He was the CEO of a company in energies (specialized electric meters installation), and customers were unable to pay their electricity bill. The initial objective of the app was to reduce user energy consumption to allow consumers to spend less.</p>
<p><span id="more-2768"></span></p>
<p>He met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentinoustelandt-energic/">Quentin Oustelandt</a>, a student passionate about this subject, and they launched with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-reneaume-aa51632/">Tristan Reneaume</a> Energic. Their genesis: buildings technical efficiency must be paired with the evolution of usages to create the best environmental impact possible.</p>
<p>Since 2019, Energic has evolved to raise awareness among its users to all environmental concerns (energy at first, and then mobility, food, waste, digital usage, lighting, water…) with clients like <a href="https://www.orange.fr/portail">Orange</a>, <a href="https://www.cofidis.fr/">Cofidis</a>, <a href="https://www.credit-agricole.fr/">Crédit Agricole</a>…</p>
<p><strong>A team of 11 people</strong> — <strong>140 000 sensitized individuals</strong> — <strong>1M objective sensibilisation for 2021</strong></p>
<h2 id="an-app-full-of-tools">An app full of tools</h2>
<p>To make behaviour evolution easier in companies and schools, Energic has developed a digital challenge built around the main environmental stakes. Energic core business is eco-responsibility. Thanks to a mobile app, they create a community within the company: the app allows them to exchange, set goals, monitor the progress, and their efforts.</p>
<p>A facilitator supports each community to give them advice, animate the use, and follow their consumption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All of our team at Energic have the spirit to change things. Everyone feels concerned about ecology; we are glad to work for a company whose match with our convictions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="meeting-with-jonathan-lecointe-cto-at-energic-in-the-company-since-the-beginning">Meeting with Jonathan Lecointe, CTO at Energic, in the company since the beginning</h3>
<p>Initially, at Energic for his Bachelor Internship, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-lecointe-427442a9/">Jonathan</a> was one of the two first dev in the company. He continues his way with work-linked training to finish his studies. At the same time, as the Energic tech team was growing, he became the CTO naturally thanks to his expertise on the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m not a partisan of a steering policy. My purpose is to make sure that the dev team has all the fundamentals in place to do their jobs in good conditions and goes in the right direction.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-willingness-to-protect-data-in-france-and-a-need-to-be-scalable-in-the-technology">The willingness to protect data in France and a need to be scalable in the technology</h2>
<p>Their first server was auto-hosted on OVH, but no one in the team was a system administrator. They met then the need to find another way to handle security and monitoring. They were looking for a solution in compliance with their ethic: Data protection is a real matter for Energic; it was not practicable to store the data in the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We were looking for a local solution, and Damien Cavailles from <a href="https://welovedevs.com/">WeLoveDevs</a> recommended Clever Cloud to us. The first thing we liked about Clever Cloud was the possibility of horizontal and vertical scalability.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So Jonathan, more than three years since your first use of our solution, how Clever Cloud impact Energic way of work?</strong></p>
<p>The beginning was straightforward. I’m a back-end developer; I just had to create a remote, push my code to it, and it was settled. We had a few hiccups because Scala support can be complicated sometimes. However, Clever Cloud’s support is still there when we have a problem; everything is transparent. Overall, the price for the service is genuinely fair. And the support team is friendly, available, even educator.</p>
<p>This year, our main challenge is to ramp up our commercial level. We launched a version 2.0  last May, and as of now, our product is improved and ready. We still need to work on our architecture to be scalable. It’s essential for us to feel safe about scaling: we sometimes have a prominent peak of activity, and Clever Cloud servers can adapt. My function is not to handle security, maintenance, or monitoring. I’m peaceful to let it in Clever Cloud specialists’ hands. Clever Cloud speed of deployment is truly comfortable. For the fun fact, earlier this day, one of my front-end collaborators needed a feature back: it took me like just 30 seconds to do it!</p>
<p><strong>How would you explain Clever Cloud in a few words?</strong></p>
<p>Clever Cloud is a great solution to host servers easily, the configuration is remarkably fast, the support is excellent, and mostly, it’s a French company.</p>
<p>Thank you Jonathan for your time!</p>

<p><span id="more-2823"></span></p>
<h2 id="console-new-tiles-and-improvements">Console: new tiles and improvements</h2>
<p>We&#39;ve been building new tiles for both organizations and overview pages. These new tiles rely on web components which are open-source. You can embed each of these components easily in your product to show to your customers. You can find each of our components here: <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-components/">https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/clever-components/</a>.</p>
<figure>
  <img style=" width: 70%;margin:0 auto;display: block;max-width:100%" alt="Rails no controller error page" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/new-inputs.png"><figcaption>Here&#8217;s an example of our new inputs, with copy-to-clipboard button.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Please note that these are in beta, so bear with us as we fix possible hiccups over time!</p>
<p>We are also developing a new type of ACLs, built on top of our next-gen auth product, allowing you to make integrations easier. Stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="geolocation-of-requests">Geolocation of requests</h3>
<p>This one may be the most obvious change: there is a near-real-time map that shows dots for requests and their location around the world. In the organization&#39;s overview, you can see requests of all your apps combined.</p>
<p><video width="70%" autoplay loop style="margin:0 auto;display: block;"><source src="//assets.clever-cloud.com/website/blog/new-map-live.mp4" type="video/mp4" /><source src="//assets.clever-cloud.com/website/blog/new-map-live.ogv" type="video/ogv" /></video></p>
<p>There is also a heatmap that shows the density of the traffic location over 24 hours. Real-time is nice, but having a track of what&#39;s happened can be pretty handy.</p>
<figure>
  <img style=" width: 70%;margin:0 auto;display: block;max-width:100%" alt="Rails no controller error page" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/new-heatmap.png"><figcaption>The heatmap view</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="http-response-codes">HTTP Response codes</h3>
<p>Here we show you the distribution of HTTP status codes in the responses of your apps. It is displayed over 24h. If you click on a status code in the legend, it will hide it from the chart. Pro tip: If your shift+click on a HTTP code in the legend, it will unselect all the other codes.</p>
<figure>
  <img style=" width: 30%;margin:0 auto;display: block;max-width:100%" alt="Rails no controller error page" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/http-response-code.png"><br />
</figure>
<h3 id="http-requests">HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>This graph represents the variation of HTTP requests on your app over 24h, with a time window of a 2, 3 or 4 hours for each graph, (depending on your windows size, responsive ftw).</p>
<figure>
  <img style=" width: 30%;margin:0 auto;display: block;max-width:100%" alt="Rails no controller error page" src="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/app/uploads/2021/08/http-requests.png"><br />
</figure>
<h2 id="access-logs--tools">Access logs &amp; tools</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-an-access-log">What is an access log?</h3>
<p>An access log records all requests that people or bots have requested from an application. When you are using Clever Cloud, your application&#39;s requests transit via our load-balancers. They receive the incoming network traffic and route it to each application. For legal reasons, we have to keep track of each request for at least a year.</p>
<h3 id="retrieving-access-logs-before">Retrieving access logs, before</h3>
<p>When a customer needed the access logs, the original process was to dive into a vast logfile and find it ourselves. But now, each Clever Cloud user can retrieve its access logs, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-access-logs-today">Retrieving access logs, today</h2>
<p>We introduced Metrics a few years ago, a tool built into the web console to give monitoring data to our users. <em>Metrics</em> relies on Warp10, a time-series database built for this kind of usage. The access logs are now stored into Warp10, as it&#39;s a part of Metrics.</p>
<p>On the Metrics page, you&#39;ll find your metrics token and URL, allowing you to request the warp10 database with Quantum (it&#39;s a (WarpScript™ IDE).</p>
<p>You can open Quantum within Metrics, and click on &quot;access logs&quot; located in the &quot;Explore your data&quot; section. Here&#39;s an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[
  &#39;&lt;TOKEN&gt;&#39;
  &#39;accessLogs&#39;
  { &#39;app_id&#39; &#39;&lt;APP_ID&gt;&#39; }
  NOW 5 s
] FETCH
</code></pre>
<p>As access logs are still quite complex to retrieve that way, we are still working on a better way to make it accessible to you. Stay tuned for the next iterations!</p>

<p><span id="more-2968"></span></p>
<p>We have been testing this with some of our customers for quite a while now. So there it is, you can now deploy any <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> code, like a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix">Phoenix</a> based website for instance. But first, if you are not familiar with both Elixir and Phoenix, let&#39;s see what it is.</p>
<p>Straight from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides productive tooling and extensible design.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s using Erlang. The language and VM that powers, among others RabbitMQ, CouchDB, Facebook/Whatsapp messaging backend, and many Telcos backend. We are talking massive scale, concurrent usage here. To go back to elixir, here&#39;s what some simple code looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">defmodule KVTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  def hello do
    :world
  end

  test &quot;greets the world&quot; do
    assert hello() == :world
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>It feels like a functional Ruby.</p>
<p>Elixir applications use the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html">Mix</a> build tool as a task runner. With that, you can scaffold projects and code, compile, test, run, manage dependencies, run database migrations, and more. Everything runs on top of OTP (Open Telecom Platform), a set of Erlang libraries and tools. And inside OTP you will find BEAM, the virtual machine that compiles Erlang and Elixir source code into bytecode and run it. So this is what you have access to when you run and Elixir application on Clever Cloud.</p>
<p>The most wide-used Elixir Framework is Phoenix. It feels like Ruby on Rails. And this is what we&#39;ll see how to deploy today. If you want to follow, make sure you have installed clever-tools and Mix</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mix phx.new hello # generate a project, say Yes to Fetch and install dependencies.
clever addon create postgresql-addon hello-phoenix-pg # create a postgres database
clever create --type elixir hello-phoenix # create an erlang application on Clever Cloud
clever service link-addon hello-phoenix-pg # link the database
clever env set CC_PHOENIX_ASSETS_DIR assets # Tell Clever Cloud where to run the js build
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate all the code you need to start a Phoenix application. Just like Rails, there are other tasks you can use to generate code. Take a look at the list of <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/phoenix_mix_tasks.html#phoenix-specific-mix-tasks">available tasks</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we should configure the database access. By default the DATABASE_URL variable is defined in <code>./config/prod.secret.exs</code>. In this file you will define all the secrets, which is to say anything that should not be hardcoded in your configuration files. The DATABASE_URL should be changed to POSTGRESQL_ADDON_URI, which is what will be available in your app. There are three other variables we can use in this file. The PORT is already configured, we just have do set a secret and a pool size limit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">clever env set SECRET_KEY_BASE Th3S3Cr3t
clever env set POOL_SIZE 5
</code></pre>
<p>And now all there is to do is run these:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git init # initialize a git repository
git add . # add all the files
git commit -m&quot;init&quot; first commit
clever deploy # push your code to Clever Cloud
clever open # open the site in your default browser
</code></pre>
<p>And you should see the Phoenix default app running 🙂 As with most applications running on Clever Cloud, you can configure your build and deployment through environment variables. Here&#39;s the current list of options:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center">
<tr>
<th><center>Name</center></th>
<th><center>Description</center></th>
<th><center>Default value</center></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CC_ELIXIR_VERSION</td


<td>Choose the Elixir version between &#8216;1.8&#8217; or `1.9`</td>
<td>`1.9`</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CC_PHOENIX_ASSETS_DIR</td


<td>Folder in which your Phoenix assets are located.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CC_PHOENIX_DIGEST_GOAL</td>
<td>Phoenix digest goal.</td>
<td>phx.digest</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CC_PHOENIX_SERVER_GOAL</td>
<td>Phoenix server goal.</td>
<td>phx.server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CC_PHOENIX_RUN_ECTO_MIGRATE</td>
<td>Whether to run &#8216;mix ecto.migrate&#8217; or not.</td>
<td>true</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now you know all the basics to start an Elixir or Phoenix project. Have a look at some other Elixir frameworks like the Bot Framework <a href="https://github.com/hedwig-im/hedwig">Hedwig</a> or the simpler web one like <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/raxx/">Raxx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hexedpackets/trot">trot</a> or <a href="https://github.com/elixir-maru/maru">Maru</a>. Please let us know what you think about this 🙂 Happy hacking!</p>

<p><span id="more-2767"></span></p>
<p>We already accept different payment methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card (powered by Stripe)</li>
<li>Paypal</li>
<li>Bank transfer: Clever Cloud accepts international bank transfers. This option will generate a reference that you will have to add to your bank transfer, as a note.</li>
</ul>
<p>and now we have just added:</p>
<ul>
<li>SEPA Direct Debit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care?</h2>
<p>SEPA Direct Debit allows you to pay invoices without getting limited by payment card ceiling. You only have to put your IBAN in the form. Then click on &quot;I AGREE&quot; and we will be able to debit your bank account after issuing your monthly invoice. Agreeing to the mandate means you allow Clever Cloud to debit your account only two days after you get the debit notification. This notification contains the invoice and is sent on the first day of each month. We first try to charge you on the 5th of this month. Would the first debit fail, new attempts will occur on the 10th, 15th and 20th of that month.</p>
<p>You are entitled to a refund under the terms and conditions of your agreement with your bank. A refund must be claimed within eight weeks, starting from the date on which your account was debited.</p>
<p>The documentation for SEPA Direct Debit mandate is here: <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/admin-console/invoices-payments/#sepa-direct-debit">https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/doc/admin-console/invoices-payments/#sepa-direct-debit</a></p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions about SEPA direct debit or any other payment methods and invoicing.</p>

<p>Following the high demand for large-sized instances, we have created many new plans. Check these out! Since the introduction of MongoDB in 2013, things have changed a little bit. In the beginning, a few plans were proposed for MongoDB. Then we introduced some updates and new names for the plans (remember &#34;Peanut&#34;, &#34;Shamrock&#34; etc. ?). [&#8230;]</p>

<p><span id="more-2967"></span></p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://clevercloud-staging.cleverapps.io/blog/company/2013/07/24/mongodb-on-clever-cloud/">introduction of MongoDB in 2013</a>, things have changed a little bit. In the beginning, a few plans were proposed for MongoDB. Then we introduced some updates and new names for the plans (remember &quot;Peanut&quot;, &quot;Shamrock&quot; etc. ?). Today, we have two major updates to release.</p>
<h2 id="numerous-new-plans">Numerous new plans</h2>
<p>From five plans, this is nineteen plans of managed MongoDB now available on Clever Cloud. Most of our users start with a simple &quot;dev&quot; plan to try things at the beginning. But as their needs are getting bigger. Jumping from a simple 1GB plan to a 100GB (when only 5GB were needed) didn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Now with the new migration tool, moving from a bigger instance without a heavy price jump is easier.</p>
<h2 id="encrypted-databases">Encrypted databases</h2>
<p>Now you can ask for encrypted at rest databases! The add-on file system can be encrypted using LUKS. The encryption mode is  XTS, which is reputed to be more resistant to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermarking_attack">watermarking attacks</a>.</p>
<p>To get your MongoDB encrypted at rest, ask the support team. A UI will be soon available to make this option automatic. Stay tuned for more add-ons! ✌️</p>
