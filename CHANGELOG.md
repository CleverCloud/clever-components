## [11.0.0](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components/compare/10.5.0...11.0.0) (2023-07-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **cc-pricing-product:** the component now displays features that have no translations registered as long as they have a `name` property. Make sure you filter out unwanted features using the `addonFeatures` (smart component usage) or `productFeatures` prop (directly set on the `cc-pricing-product` component). See the related issue for more info.
* **cc-addon-encryption-at-rest-option:** The `price` in the `options` property is no more needed on components:
    - cc-addon-elasticsearch-options
    - cc-addon-jenkins-options
    - cc-addon-mongodb-options
    - cc-addon-mysql-options
    - cc-addon-postgresql-options
    - cc-addon-redis-options
* **cc-error:** remove component
* **cc-addon-admin:** change `error` property from an enum to a boolean.
* **cc-addon-credentials:** the `icon` property is now `image`. It still requires a URL.
* **cc-block:** the `icon` property now requires an icon object instead of a URL. If you want to pass a URL nevertheless, use the new `image` property instead.
* **cc-badge:** the `icon-alt` property is now `icon-accessible-name`.
* **cc-badge:** the `icon-src` property is now `icon` and requires an icon object instead of a URL.
* **cc-icon:** `IconModel` interface should be imported from `src/components/common.types.d.ts` file and not `src/components/cc-icon/cc-icon.types.d.ts` file anymore.
* **cc-flex-gap:** remove component
* **cc-tile-consumption:** remove component
* **cc-action-dispatcher:** remove component
* **cc-pricing-page:** We needed to be able to style and move the pricing components inside the `cc-pricing-page` component a lot more. For instance, the `cc-pricing-header` can now be positioned wherever one wants within the `cc-pricing-page` because everything is slotted within the `cc-pricing-page`. The smart `cc-pricing-page` smart component was mainly interacting with `cc-pricing-header` data (fetching `zones`). This is why we removed the `cc-pricing-page.smart` part and added a `cc-pricing-header.smart`.
* **cc-pricing-estimation:** see more details below
    - add new way of handling the component state and passing data to the component.
    - use the new smart API.
* **cc-pricing-header:** see more details below
    - add new way of handling the component state and passing data to the component.
    - use the new smart API.
    - add a temporality selector component.
* **cc-pricing-product-consumption:** see more details below
    - add new way of handling the component state and passing data to the component.
    - the smart component now uses the new smart API.
    - remove the slots for heading, description and image.
* **cc-pricing-table:** The `cc-pricing-table` component has been merged into the `cc-pricing-product` component.
* **cc-pricing-product:** see details below
    - add new way of handling the component state and passing data to the component.
    - remove the heading, desc and image/logo slots.
    - use the new smart API.
    - directly render a table within the component instead of relying on a
     `cc-pricing-table` sub-component to do so.
    - merge the `cc-pricing-table` component and stories into `cc-pricing-product`.
